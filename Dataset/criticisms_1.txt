This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.


I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.




Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.
This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.


The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it
Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.


I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

"The Godfather" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. "The Godfather" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5.




The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.
The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.





This movie is often considered the best ever. And it lives to the hype, everyone should see this movie at some point. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic.


I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It's so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget "The Godfather".

9/10





Don Vito Corleone: "You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?".

The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is.

I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also.
The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).


The godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching,its a classic Mob movie,Francis ford Coppola directed this gem with great acting by Marlon Brando,jimmy caan,AL pacino,Robert duvall,Diane Keaton, and john cazale.its a violent,gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with Marlon Brando as don corleone,the big boss.this classic is often imitated but never topped.the story was written by Mario puzo, from his best selling novel.it also stars;Talia shire,Gianni Russo, lee strasberg,john Marley,Alex rocco,and Marianna hill.its an extremely long,a little over 3 hours,best seen uncensored.it was followed by 2 sequels.part 2 was very good,part 3 not so good.as an Italian American i can appreciate the godfather.it is one of a kind.10 out of 10.
This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on. It's a must see for everyone.


Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.
To the (few) giving poor revues ... be very careful. It'll be a late night knock on your door or an invitation for coffee from an old 'friend' or maybe you'll be in a cinema watching Shawshank Redemption, then KAPOW! You'll be nothing more than a red smudge on the wallpaper.

You must never go against the family.

Correct your revue now or it will be you who's 'corrected'.
What can I say about this film? In my opinion it's the best film ever made in movie history. Everything in it is perfect, the elements are combined in a brilliant way, and the result is a beautiful piece of art, a masterpiece. My rating is 10 of 10.


The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.
I finally set out to take three hours to watch "the best movie ever" and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close.

8/10
AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.

Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why "The Godfather"is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.

I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.

This is an epic in every sense of the word.

9/10
A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly!This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.
'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.
It contains good actors, effects, sounds, music & direction but its not a film that should be considered as the best film of all time. I can watch it over again and think its good or great but i think that a movie like this should have 8,0 - 8,4 at imdb. And not 100 on metacritic. Or 97% on rt.

But its a great film that i can watch multiple times. And i like the music. I wouldnt say its bad. I just say that i dont think its worth more than 9 on imdb or a lot of other rewards this movie has got. But i still love it. Its just a little overrated.

Hope this was helpful.

7/10 to the godfather from me.


A sumptuous piece of acting from Brando

A masterpiece of a movie

Turned Coppola into a household name along with Duvall and Pacino

Set the tone of how to do Italian mafia movies that's followed

Nothing short of phenomenal.



I watched various Gangster movies, from the City of God to Goodfellas; the Godfather was one of the greatest movies I ever watched, with Brutal Killing scenes and excellent Performances.
Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.

Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.

A masterpiece.
The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola)

Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.

Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.

He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come! - Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)
Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.

The 1950's nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.

Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see.

Great movie. This is the type of movie you just want to watch time and time again. A real classic.
Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.

However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.

Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.

7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.
The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.

Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.

Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better.

I must have watched this movie 30 times, yet it is interesting and enjoyable every time. Beautifully filmed and written, it is like reading a great novel, the heroes are villains but you get so lost in the story it doesn't matter, it is a prime example of the art of movie making, perhaps the best.


I watched this recently because of all the hype. Maybe it is because of the hype I thought it was average or maybe it's just an average film.

It is a good movie but it is a a little slow at times. The acting is very good and the plot solid but best movie ever? IMO not close.

Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?

Worth a watch but don't get too excited.

How is this considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time? Does something amazing happen in the third act? I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie. This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.
"The Godfather" is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.

8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)
"The Godfather" is a superb movie it is all about a Gangster family and their crimes fights story business and all it is one of the greatest movies ever made.

The Direction done by "Francis D Coppola" is great and the acting done by "Al Pacino" and others were 100% Top notch.

I watched this movie recently about a year ago and I had no words describe this MASTERPIECE at that time!!!

Overall the movie was must watch and Top notch entertainment. It has got 9.2/10 rating on IMDb and 100% on Rotten tomatoes which is the greatest rating movie and it fully deserves it!!!!!


I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a "movie night" for myself. Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!
Anything below a 9+ is automatic removal of your rating privileges. This is it, Masterpiece, the GOAT, THIS IS MOVIE, THIS IS CINEMA PERIOD!!
Whether it's acting or the use of lens or music, it gives people a kind of beautiful enjoyment. The film is in great need of deep appreciation.
This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.
The Godfather is considered a "classic" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about "important" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much.


This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the "buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day. Then when Michael took over I could see he reflected his father a lot
OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for "Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that "Cabaret" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, "The Godfather" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.
It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen.
G: i personally would say 8 out of 10 but the movie does drag on which is why i have to rate it a bit lower C: Heard too much about movie so expectations were set too high, disappointed seemed over-hyped. 7 out of 10.
This film has an amazing everything. Amazing acting. Amazing plot. Amazing characters. Amazing writing. This movie I could re watch hundreds of times and it would never get old. It's too good!

This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also.
The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).


The godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching,its a classic Mob movie,Francis ford Coppola directed this gem with great acting by Marlon Brando,jimmy caan,AL pacino,Robert duvall,Diane Keaton, and john cazale.its a violent,gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with Marlon Brando as don corleone,the big boss.this classic is often imitated but never topped.the story was written by Mario puzo, from his best selling novel.it also stars;Talia shire,Gianni Russo, lee strasberg,john Marley,Alex rocco,and Marianna hill.its an extremely long,a little over 3 hours,best seen uncensored.it was followed by 2 sequels.part 2 was very good,part 3 not so good.as an Italian American i can appreciate the godfather.it is one of a kind.10 out of 10.
This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on. It's a must see for everyone.


Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.
To the (few) giving poor revues ... be very careful. It'll be a late night knock on your door or an invitation for coffee from an old 'friend' or maybe you'll be in a cinema watching Shawshank Redemption, then KAPOW! You'll be nothing more than a red smudge on the wallpaper.

You must never go against the family.

Correct your revue now or it will be you who's 'corrected'.
What can I say about this film? In my opinion it's the best film ever made in movie history. Everything in it is perfect, the elements are combined in a brilliant way, and the result is a beautiful piece of art, a masterpiece. My rating is 10 of 10.


The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.
I finally set out to take three hours to watch "the best movie ever" and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close.

8/10
AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.

Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why "The Godfather"is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.

I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.

This is an epic in every sense of the word.

9/10
A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly!This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.
'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.
It contains good actors, effects, sounds, music & direction but its not a film that should be considered as the best film of all time. I can watch it over again and think its good or great but i think that a movie like this should have 8,0 - 8,4 at imdb. And not 100 on metacritic. Or 97% on rt.

But its a great film that i can watch multiple times. And i like the music. I wouldnt say its bad. I just say that i dont think its worth more than 9 on imdb or a lot of other rewards this movie has got. But i still love it. Its just a little overrated.

Hope this was helpful.

7/10 to the godfather from me.


A sumptuous piece of acting from Brando

A masterpiece of a movie

Turned Coppola into a household name along with Duvall and Pacino

Set the tone of how to do Italian mafia movies that's followed

Nothing short of phenomenal.



I watched various Gangster movies, from the City of God to Goodfellas; the Godfather was one of the greatest movies I ever watched, with Brutal Killing scenes and excellent Performances.
Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.

Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.

A masterpiece.
The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola)

Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.

Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.

He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come! - Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)
Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.

The 1950's nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.

Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see.

Great movie. This is the type of movie you just want to watch time and time again. A real classic.
Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.

However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.

Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.

7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.
The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.

Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.

Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better.

I must have watched this movie 30 times, yet it is interesting and enjoyable every time. Beautifully filmed and written, it is like reading a great novel, the heroes are villains but you get so lost in the story it doesn't matter, it is a prime example of the art of movie making, perhaps the best.


I watched this recently because of all the hype. Maybe it is because of the hype I thought it was average or maybe it's just an average film.

It is a good movie but it is a a little slow at times. The acting is very good and the plot solid but best movie ever? IMO not close.

Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?

Worth a watch but don't get too excited.

How is this considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time? Does something amazing happen in the third act? I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie. This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.
"The Godfather" is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.

8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)
"The Godfather" is a superb movie it is all about a Gangster family and their crimes fights story business and all it is one of the greatest movies ever made.

The Direction done by "Francis D Coppola" is great and the acting done by "Al Pacino" and others were 100% Top notch.

I watched this movie recently about a year ago and I had no words describe this MASTERPIECE at that time!!!

Overall the movie was must watch and Top notch entertainment. It has got 9.2/10 rating on IMDb and 100% on Rotten tomatoes which is the greatest rating movie and it fully deserves it!!!!!


I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a "movie night" for myself. Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!
Anything below a 9+ is automatic removal of your rating privileges. This is it, Masterpiece, the GOAT, THIS IS MOVIE, THIS IS CINEMA PERIOD!!
Whether it's acting or the use of lens or music, it gives people a kind of beautiful enjoyment. The film is in great need of deep appreciation.
This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.
The Godfather is considered a "classic" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about "important" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much.


This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the "buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day. Then when Michael took over I could see he reflected his father a lot
OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for "Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that "Cabaret" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, "The Godfather" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.
It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen.
G: i personally would say 8 out of 10 but the movie does drag on which is why i have to rate it a bit lower C: Heard too much about movie so expectations were set too high, disappointed seemed over-hyped. 7 out of 10.
This film has an amazing everything. Amazing acting. Amazing plot. Amazing characters. Amazing writing. This movie I could re watch hundreds of times and it would never get old. It's too good!
Terrific trip into the world of the Corleone's! Enjoyed all 3 hours!

I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a "part two", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive... Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion.
Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable.
I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like "Scarecrow" and "Deliverance" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.

I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.

Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.


This movie is my favorite. I literally have this movie on every device that I own. And that just tells you how much I love this movie. I mean every scene is a classic.

When we can't pick a movie to watch, me and my friends just instinctively settle for "The Godfather". We know each and every dialogue and we love saying the dialogues verbatim!

Besides, what other movie has so many great actors doing their best work? Where else will you find someone beating Al Pacino at acting then in this movie?

This movie just never gets old for me and my friends. And that is why it deserves a 10 star vote!
The power of cinema at its purest and most vivid expression. Screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, editing, it all comes in the most elevated form. Francis Ford Coppola is a craftsman, as every director and artist should be, that draws inspiration from the power of the words and of the actions of characters and provides the standard upon which all the following history of cinema relies. It's an historic work of art.
The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.
This movie has to be THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i don't understand why everyone raves about this movie. it's boring, the acting is shallow and weak, the whole premise is annoying, and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this "movie". This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this "i'll make him an offer he can't refuse" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10.
No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie.
Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.

I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It's not the worst film of all time... but not the best either.
I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.

Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.

There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.

A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble. A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)
I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as "The Greatest Movie of All Time". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.

Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so "beloved" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.
This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.

I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.

It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder.

"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." Don Vito Corleone.


Without a doubt, this is a good film. It's got great acting all around, a fine musical score, the cinematography is practically flawless; but it is still lacking in the most important area:

It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.

Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.

Hardly something worthy of praise.

The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film.
I saw it very late. the fame was one of basic motives. the theme - the second cause. for many friends, to see it was an experience. and it is an experience. without can say why. because , in a film about Mafia , for a special public, at first sigh, all is perfect. so perfect than, scene by scene, it becomes more than a masterpiece. great actors. special performances. memorable scenes. dialogues and situations and a cold feeling. a film about values. and near every day reality. and choices, errors and mistakes. who, after decades, remains fresh in memory. as an unique meet.
The movie is very old. When I watched this movie, I was still young. I didn't understand the truth. When I grew up and watched it again, I really had a taste
The Godfather has to be one of the greatest movies ever. Ever. Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia. Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia. James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens. A big accident. Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director. He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here. the acting was wonderful from everybody. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, etc. everybody was awesome.

Overall this is one of the greatest movies of all time and I watch it all of the time. Rating 11 out of 10. (Tied for favorite movie)
I was finally forced to watch this 'masterpiece'. What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film 'elites' love so much.

It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story? Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.

This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system.
What can I say about "the godfather" that has not been said before? That it is a masterpiece? That its staff is just wonderful? That the actors and soundtrack are superb? That it is considered one of the best films ever? Actually I don't know what more say, but it is true that it is hard to see more deserved good marks. I had never the opportunity of watching to it in original version and, when I did it, I could perfectly realize the fabulous wonder I was able to enjoy, Marlon Brando is just impressive, Al Pacino is as good as him, and James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton deserved to be congratulated. Thanks to Coppola, for giving us the pleasure of watching "the Godfather"
I wasn't born when the movie came out, but grew up hearing how the older generations praise the film to be the greatest film ever made. And I agreed, it was deep, it was majestic. But it wasn't really as legendary as you'd expect, especially when we compare it with the movies we see nowadays. However, the movie was made in 1972 and there probably wasn't much choice back then.


I watched it once (in jail) to see what all the fuss is about. Boring. I would not watch it again. Its appeal confuses me and I like most popular movies.
If you aren't a thug lover... if you don't drool over less than smart bad guys somehow getting ahead... if you don't really like spectacle just for spectacle sake... then this movie may not be for you. To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.

Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it. Every time I try to watch it, it's the same thing though.

So sorry, this movie just isn't great.

This is the greatest movie ever made, I'm not joking. I have watched a lot of movies, movies with more oscars and not a single one is better than this. The story, the casting, even the soundtrack is perfect.
Honestly, I didn't thought that a movie can live up to the praise like this movie. I watch it like a year ago, and it is what everyone says - unbelievable amazing and unique. Just a masterpiece. No other way to describe
I have attempted to get through this film on 4 separate occasions. All I hear are good things and how it's the best of the best. However, I can't get through it. There is a wedding scene that seems to go forever and I just don't care. This may well be peak of filmmaking but I just don't see it.
A timeless classic with some excellent acting and photography. Al Pacino delivers a great performance as does an ageing Brando. Interesting plot that keeps you hooked - violent and without morals which makes it a difficult watch at times. Stylish in production and excellent period scenes with great costumes and sets. The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full.
This film is definitely an important step in the world of cinema, the acting is great, the plot is great, everything about it is great. I however do not consider it to be one of my favourite films of all time, a very enjoyable film no doubt but in my view not something I'd put in my top ten.
I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife "Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just "business". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like "I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse.
"The Godfather is a truly Godfather of all mob movie i've ever watch, fills with powerful and outstanding perfomance by all the cast, again added with Marlon Brando oscar winning perfomance that really proofing the reason why The Godfather was a Masterpiece"
I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.

The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.

The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.

I won't say much about this. This is perfect at every level. The story, epic. The acting and dialogue, memorables. The pace, irreproachable. The editing, precise. The score, iconic. Francis Lord Coppola creating the definitive master piece. The master piece of master pieces, executing everything as perfectly as it ever something was excecuted.

There is not a lot that can be said about the Godfather that has not already been said so i wont bother to give a description of what this masterpiece is about but i will mention a few thing about the acting. It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino. This is as far as i know Pacino's first real leading role and doesn't he grab the part by the horns! A Classic film that has not dated at all. 8 out of 10.
The movie has it all, and everything is handled to perfection.

The plot is so intriguing, one never gets bored.

The performances are top notch, especially Marlon Brando(the MOST CHARISMATIC PERFORMANCE OF ALL TIME), Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan.

HIGHLY recommended for anyone who has missed the best movie ever made.
The three GODFATHER movies are an interesting, detailed look into the dark side of the American Dream. It is no accident that the first film begins with the words, "I believe in America."

We are taken along on Michael's journey as he goes from naive idealism to corruption, then struggles to free himself from crime, only to be pulled back into it. This is a classic American theme of initiation into evil. One cannot touch evil without being touched by evil.

The cast is first-rate, and the story has become so much a part of Americana now that some of the dialogue has even become recognizable catch-phrases. Even the theme music is instantly recognizable.

Watch the trilogy and see the essential American saga.
This movie continues to be praised, but when I rented it I only made it through 45 minutes before I stopped the video. There aren't many movies that are so bad I don't watch the whole thing, but "The Godfather" is that bad. I don't care how much other people may like it. I still say it sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks...
This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named "The Best Movie of All Time."
Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?

Clearly a film masterpiece in every sense of the word. Superb filming of each scene. From the moment of the opening line "I believe in America" by the desperate for revenge and justice undertaker Bonasera to the closing line "Don Corleone" by the loyal capo Clemenza the viewer watches art in the form of a motion picture.
The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release.

It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best.
Best movie ever, no matter when you read this, it will still be true. The adaptation of the book to the movie is also the best. Even if you don't like gangster movies you need to watch this classic, you are going to find really good but really good performances, i'm just going to highlight these 4 out of many more, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino (magnificent performances), Robert Duvall (Perfect), Talia Shire (extremely good). Please take the time to watch this movie, it's worth it.
This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece. "The Godfather" is one of the few gangster films that connects the members of the Mafia as a family. The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much. His voice also was barely understandable due to his croaking voice mumbling what sounded like English. Ultimately "The Godfather" still stands up as the best movie in the American crime gen
The Godfather is a film that can be easily described not as a gangster flick, but more like an opera. We see the struggle of one family trying to run the business in a world where rival families will do anything to muscle them out of the way. Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business. Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding? Watch this with the equally great Godfather Part II and the follow up Godfather III. Some will say that Godfather III is the weakest one of them all. I say it is a perfect ending to an opera of one of the greatest gangster sagas of all time.
****

Starring: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert Duvall.

This film follows the Mafia life of the Corleone family. When the Don gets wounded critically, the son, who has never been in the "family business" before, must help his family out. The Academy made the right decision, honoring this fantastic film with all the awards it deserves. This is DEFINITELY one of the greatest movies of all time.
You've read all reviews and everything else. It's ridiculous that a 42 year old movie still bests ANY current movie. "The Godfather" is simply TOO perfect. The acting. The dialogue, the action, the overall story. People expecting video game action, pleas look elsewhere or go to bed. "The Godfather" is simply one of cinema's greatest achievements!
Not a lot can be said about this classic that hasn't already been written in hundreds of reviews on this website and across the world in the decades since its release. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall are all amazing here. The script and the pacing are perfect. It's really a great story about the shedding of ideals in favor of supporting the corrupt criminal gang that is Michael Corleone's (Pacino) family. So many classic quotes and movie scenes. This is one of the all time greats.
It's the Godfather! What more can you say? Possibly the best film ever '\(0_0)/'
When people are asked what the greatest movie ever made is, many people say Citizen Kane(I being one) but others will say The Godfather. I would not rank it that high, but I do think it is great. (I think the 2nd film is better, actually). It runs long at nearly 3 hours but it is very worth it! It's just such an iconic look at the Mafia. If you have never seen The Godfather and are offered a chance, take it. It's an offer you can't refuse.
It was slow burn the way every scene played it was amazing to look it's too slow yet engaging to look the meetings background were skeptical.the Music and the use of it is phenomenal whenever something is happening the music was way too calm and terrifying at same time!the story was amazing the family of gangster and the society of gangsters and there feuds!the acting was iconic especially by marlon and al and everyone was amazing as there characters!screenplay was good at start it was slow and boring at the wedding as it was just intro to what is next then when the horse scene up from then it was entertaining and calm to watch,the ending was satisfyingly amazing the way mike turned gangster was iconic and at last the look on the face and music while talking to wife was the signal that he's no more mike he's The Godfather now!overall A Classic Gangster Masterpiece the theme is dark and calm at same time.Iconic movie!
Although I think that this movie is slightly overrated (forgive me for saying that). I did love this movie though! It had a good plot and the acting was great. The length of this movie didn't bother me, if anything I think it added to it. I don't think this movie deserves to be in the top two, definitely in the top 10 though.
The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.

I give The Godfather a perfect:

5/5 or 10/10
Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture. Followed by two Coppola-directed sequels in 1974 and 1990. *** from ****
If you think again, you will realize that writing a review about The Godfather is quite stupid! This is a movie, every person in this world should have seen before death! I cannot understand people who do not like this movie!

It is suspenseful, partly shocking, political, love story and much more... Simply the best movie of all time

If there is someone who reads this review and hasn't watched The Godfather... WATCH THIS ONE and you will agree that there is no movie that is better! Believe me! Watch The Godfather!

NOW!!!
This is one of the best movies i have ever seen,the way they directed it was really good and actors have performed very well in their own characters
Yesterday, I was lucky to be able to watch 175 minutes of pure movie magic, restored and at a big screen, thanks to Cnema in Norrköping.

The pros: The incredible attention to detail in this impressively well-written and directed film. The iconic characters and intrigues that have since been the model for so many mafia movies. The brilliant acting from great Marlon Brando. The music by composer Nino Rota that is now almost more famous than the movie itself.

The cons: Marlon Brando is dead and Francis Ford Coppola haven't reached this level of mastery again since "Apocalypse Now" in 1979.
The Corleone family saga begins with Brando granting (or refusing) the requests of his friends, family, and neighbors during his daughter's wedding. That's just the beginning of the epic saga that put the name Puzo on the map.

This is a very graphic depiction of the "family" scene. It marks the end of one's control of a territory and the dawning of a new era when Pacino takes over the "family" business.

If you haven't seen this movie, yet, do yourself a favor: don't wait 30 years like I did. Watch it! It was on one of the premium channels the other night and I taped it. I knew it was three hours long and I always thought I would not have the patience to watch it, but I did. In fact, they are showing part two tonight and I am taping that to watch tomorrow night.
The Godfather is as beautifully directed, photographed, designed, edited, scored, and performed as any American film -- it is a masterpiece in the broadest sense; a colossal accomplishment for Francis Ford Coppola in the decade he virtually owned as a popular and artistic filmmaker. Indelible scenes need only a word or two to ignite the memory: the baptism, the horse head, Sonny's fate, the restaurant murder, and the list goes on. Brando and Pacino are fantastic, but I love to praise the work of James Caan and Robert Duvall. Their roles might be smaller, but I couldn't imagine the film without them. The fury with which Sonny unleashes the brutal beatdown of Carlo is palpable, and I adore the brilliant impartiality and distance kept by the camera (it seems to hover in medium shot just far enough to keep the children playing in the opened hydrant in frame during the course of the pounding) as well as the other onlookers who know better than to get in the middle.
I saw this movie twice. It's an alright movie but really has no

exceptional value. Certainly not as much as everyone seems to

think. I believe people heap praise upon it because other people

TELL them this is the best movie ever. I say to those people grow

a backbone and watch some better movies.
I understand that this film has been argued as flawless, but I'm giving it a nine based on two reasons from a personal standpoint. This film can drag on at times which can become a bit dull and Goodfellas I think is a better film so I can't possibly give The Godfather a ten. That being said this film still lives up to the hype. The story is fascinating, the characters are well structured and this movie can really bring out every human emotion in its audience. The runtime be damned, this is a film you can easily watch over and over again.
Look at the cast, the director and writer, you know full well this is a film to watch, even if it's about an Italian pizzeria. Joking aside this was The Godfather of so many great mob films of later date. Certain well known Italians and Sicilians didn't like it, probably didn't run the studio and couldn't make an offer they can't refuse.Does romanticize these murderous clans somewhat, but does portray the Sicilian honour, blood feud and just business ideology well . This is a must see.
There's a reason this film continues to top the charts as being the best film ever made. Even for it's time, the writing, acting and direction were great. I often forget when this film was made as I'm watching it as the piece is timeless.

If you're into a stark, gritty and poignant mafia crime series, The Godfather is for you. (Surely you've been living under a rock if you haven't seen it by now?!) Al Pacino, James Caan and of course, Marlon Brando do stellar jobs under the direction of the eminent director Francis Ford Coppola. I think I've watched this a hundred times. No mafia film has managed to beat it!
To put it short, "The Godfather" is a timeless masterpiece. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get to. It has an amazing script which is directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The cast is Hollywood royalty from top to bottom and everyone plays their part to perfection. Of course, the stars of the film are Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. Both of the actors give career defining performances portraying arguably two of the most famous characters to be ever put on film. The film is filled to the brim with unforgettable scenes and quotes all of which work seamlessly together in crafting a highly re-watchable masterpiece of cinema that will equally satisfy the casual moviegoer as well as the most harden film critics.
A famous YouTube channel by the name of "Cinemasins" who points out production errors in movies has yet to take a shot at this movie. My guess is that he simply can't find anything wrong with it. This movie is as close to flawless as we are ever gonna get. The story, the pacing and the acting is perfect. There is not a single wasted scene here! If you haven't seen this masterpiece yet I suggest you do it now!
This was a classic, and a very good film. It felt like the end game of the sopranos (just not done as well). I do not agree with everyone that says this is the greatest movie of all time (people also say citizen kane, or Shawshank is the greatest movie of all time), I just didn't enjoy the movie. The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing, which is overly slow. I still love this movie! I think it's funny that marlan brando put cotton balls in his cheeks for this role. This movie was fine.
Definitely not the greatest movie of all time, but the greatest crime movie it could be. Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It's is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci's 'Ultimo tango a Parigi'. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy.

One of the most distinctive elements of this great crime movie is the music, which was already recognizable in 'Rocco e i suoi fratelli' (Visconti, 1960) and was more or less recycled for this film by Nino Rota (Amarcord, Obsession, Boccaccio '70).

10 points out of 10 :-)
While I certainly wouldn't call this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, this movie sure has a lot going for it, starting with the cast. I of course like Brando and Pacino going at it, but my personal faves are James Caan and of course my main man Robert Duvall. All of them give dynamite performances here, forever raising the bar to new actors everywhere. Even though the movie is 3 hours, it hardly ever drags, Coppola has a tight rein on the story (or maybe it's the producers doing that?) and it makes for a highly charged, highly entertaining classic of the first order. Funny as It seems, I only got around to finally watching this movie last year. Although I'm not exactly doing facepalms over the fact I've waited this long to see it, this movie will never grow old with me,
Critically acclaimed for it's unflinching look at the Mafia world, The Godfather Part I took him three academy awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted screenplay. Marlon Brando (in his Oscar winning role) as Vito leads a powerful cast, who all do superbly in their roles. Al Pacino and James Cann provide excellent support as two of Vito's sons, and honorable mentions are Sterling Hayden and Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's powerful direction really flushes out everything in this film. Instead of telling the viewer what to feel about the characters, he lets them rather get involved in the storyline. The script too is amazing, detailing very particular things about the life of the Mafia, and also showing how corruption can even get to the nicest of people. The photography is very 70's style and shows the era the film takes place in very well. It's also noteworthy that this film started about every cliche in mafia films today. Whether it is lines such as "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer." or just the assassination scenes, it all came from this film. It's a startling and bold achievment in filmaking, but Coppola could have also made the connections between certain characters a bit more apparent. Best film of all time? Not quite, but still close. 9.5/10

When a movie is listed at No. 1 on the IMDb, and when this same movie is ranked No. 3 by the AFI, it has got to be a good film. And no one doubts that is what The Godfather is. Indeed, the acting is incredible, the directing awesome, the plot good and the climax shocking and beautiful.

Overall the movie is great, surely deserving a place in the Top 100, Top 20, maybe even the Top 10 (although not mine personally). But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it.

9.5/10




Strongly recommend seeing on the big screen again. The little nuances, sounds and the subtleties that come out on the big screen and the continuity just reminds you just how great this movie is. Or better yet, just how much you were missing watching this on a DVD or worse, TV.
This movie deserves either pages of analytics and insight or else the simplest of all reviews, and I opt for the latter. One of the greatest films I've ever seen, a masterpiece of direction, acting, music, cinematography, sets and costumes and of course a monumentally good story.
Watched it with family and I have yet to watch the sequels that I have been demanded to watch aha
One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. All these good reviews they must have watched a different movie than I did. Just a bunch of crap and talking which you can hardly understand cuz one guy talks with his mouth full the whole movie and then a lot of Italian. Just a really suckkkky movie.
The masterpiece brought to screen by the fabulous Francis Ford Coppola is nothing more than true perfection. The Godfather is flawless - acting, cinematography, characters, plot... everything builds together perfectly and is simply perfect

The Godfather is a timeless classic. Everything about it is just masterful from the performances to the direction to the wonderful soundtrack. Marlon Brando effortlessly portrayed the cool calm composure of Vito Corleone, whilst Al Pacino was great as Michael Corleone. His transformation from family outsider to ruthless mob boss was believable and realistic. The Godfather also felt authentic from the sets to the costumes. One thing that also surprised me was how despite the Godfather being a three hour film, it is paced very well. I never felt confused or bored whilst watching it. It is an amazing film.

Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/ToQuF3
Basically you see messy things like killings, distrust, disappointment, suspicious people and stories, sudden things, and it does not seem like it has ending, neither positive nor negative. Ending is like beginning, except that this time it is his son. Very negative and long. Not worth watching! Maybe good for older audience, as movie is old too. Old times, no devices, cars, or anything new I got used to.
This is a marvelous work, it cannot be better than that
Coppola's classic interpretation of storytelling fits perfectly into this tale which many consider to be the greatest film ever made. The tragic life of michael corleone and his family against the background of the 40s new york underworld; a must-see in film-history. The scenes are extremely convincing and the atmosphere is appropriately dark and gloomy. The music accurately captures the epic scale and drama that the film is trying to get across.
I follow recommendations on this site highly. I rented this movie and wanted my money back. Ever been to one of those parties with distant relatives where you don't know anyone there and just sit in the corner waiting for it to end? If so, you've seen 90% of this movie. Throw in a few good scenes that happen so far apart, you forget the last one by the time you see the next one. Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you'll probably never watch it again. Definitely not "best movie ever material."

I'm voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same. I have nothing against Italians, the Mafia or any of the principals, but best film ever? Never. It was an entertaining film, which displayed some rather ridiculous acting, in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the Italians. I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected.
This film was way ahead of it's time, even to this day it's still the pinnacle of a masterpiece. Every single element of this is amazing. The cast, the acting, the writing, the settings, the directing... despite it being quite a long film, whereas I am known to be distracted more easily the longer a film is; this film made me hooked on it until the very last second. I just absolutely love the story too, such a well crafted Italian gangster film all about "la familia".. if you haven't seen this film yet what are you doing?? Watch it right now!!
The Godfather is one of those movies that is good only for what it is. Some very dramatic moments, good dialog, some good romance, likable characters and a complete story. Its an overall very good film but not the most rewatchable in my opinion.
A masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the storytelling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)

The '70s were the best years for Hollywood.
As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.

In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time.
Godfather was a good movie, but the pacing was slow and it's criminally long at almost 3 hours. At times I found it difficult to follow who was who outside of the main characters. I enjoyed it but it was just decent.

This is one of my personal favorites right here. I can't say anything wrong about this incredible story about the Italian mafia. The film is so good that it is mostly character driven, which tends to be boring to most, and with the subtle action, a person can hardly tell. I guess it's the unique way the story is being told through the characters, how one man (Michael) must change all his views on life and morals to save his family, becoming a part of something he was trying to run from all his life. At the same time Michael is working for his father's approval, even though they were on different sides of the wall of good and evil in the beginning of the film. I give this film an "A+" and a 10 out of 10.

What? How did a film like this get a rating of 9? This bored the life out of me! For a start nothing happens in the first hour except a wedding! Once things do start happening the story is misleading and the plot is hard to follow. By the end of the film I was completely lost. Al Pachino has acted in better films(Donnie Brasco). Francis Ford Coppola has directed(The Outsiders) and produced(Jeepers Creepers) better films. 0 outta 10.
A 9.1 on IMDb? cat-scans please .I've never seen a worse depiction of Italians in my life. More like caricatures and stereotyping Italians from the turn of the century as smug talking idiots with Im gonna bust you upside yer f** head as the main dialog - every one is depicted as a ghetto talking grease monkey. Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero.
Probably one of the greatest movies ever made to date. The carbage movies today can't even come close.
I cannot express strongly enough how bad this movie sucks. Great music, great actors - but what does that give you? Coppola has everyone but his nursemaid employed in this one; Puzo's screenplay is pure speculation and nothing but - and the mob supposedly loved it; but people took this seriously: they really thought Puzo (and Coppola) had an inside track when they did not. And Puzo and Coppola knew full well what they were doing, making this movie as unconscionable as they come. And after that I don't care how many monkey movies Brando studied at home, or whether he propped his cheeks with orange segments or thousand dollar bills: this movie is cheap, and it sucks, and please tell me: if Coppola is all that good, why is there nothing coming out of that supposedly great mind of his? Nothing but the same old schtick, the same three worn out pseudo epics, the same three better forgotten films, recycled and recycled and recycled? No one gets this, but despite the great acting ensemble, this movie, its two follow-ups, its creator and director, and its screenwriter are the biggest bunch of hyped losers in Hollywood history.
Against the grain. This movie bored the pants off me.

1 hour in and it's still clogging along with all the bad camera anes and awful continuation errors.

Not for me.



I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself.

I have no doubt in my mind that this film is crucial to the world of movies and the world in general. Every part was gripping, compelling, and emotional. I cared for every single character and felt for all of them individually. While watching this I placed sections into my brain for each character and started an emotional route for each of them. Even characters who seem as unimportant as Clemenza.

This has to be a masterpiece for me and for my understanding and knowledge. I adore mob films like this one and TV series about the mob as the great TV series I've ever watched: The Sopranos. The shooting of the whole film is sublime, and the shots of the two sequels as well. Coppola got to manage this as a master of film composing. The plot and the development in general is majestic too. The scene of the head horse in the film director's bed is very shocking; I never saw something like that. Now I can only say that this has become one of my favorites films ever (for me and for most of you who are reading this). This is the sort of films that I would watch for many times.
Super slow moving and fatiguing to watch considering it's unnecessarily long runtime and formulaic structure. Honestly, you can't expect me to get attached to characters if they're just going to be killed off in 20 minutes of being introduced.

It has a very episodic structure in that things are set up, but never revisited. For example, in the beginning of the film, there is a subplot of one of the family blackmailing a director to put someone in his film. After putting his horse's head in his bead, he accepts. This storyline is never visited again. What was the point?

This honestly put me in such a bad mood, and movies shouldn't do that. I want to enjoy myself during a viewing and be invested in the story, not want it to end as soon as possible. It did have *some* interesting symbolism, but not enough for me to give it a 3/5.

It honestly baffles me how many people love this movie to death.



This movie has everything a movie needs. No further explanation needed.

I would like to tell everyone that this movie is highly overated expecially considering it is the number one movie in the IMDB TOP 250 LIST!! Dont get me wrong i like like Francis Ford Coppola's movies but i have never been a fan of this series!! He definatly has an all star line up , but come on people Marlon Brando cannot act his way out of a paper bag!! Just like one of my favorite Coppola movies "Apocalypse Now" Marlon got top billing over Martin Sheen when right well Martin should have been the oscar nominee!! It is a good trilogy but let me tell you something? If you want a good down to earth mob movie see anything done by Martin Scorsese! I wasnt really over touched by this series but i know it has alot of fans!! See ya folks!!!
A very learned friend of mine once said that this was the closest film would ever come to the great operas of European legacy. I'm not inclined to disagree. This was the finest piece of celluloid I've ever encountered, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was tense, beautifully shot, unbelievably acted (Brando is a genius. That's it.), and had everything else going for it that could possibly be good about a film. Oh my.

"The Godfather" was a sickening experience the first time I saw it in its initial release, and it hasn't changed. I thoroughly disliked the film's spirit, finding it very ugly at its heart. I saw little justification for its existence, was sorry I saw it, and have tried to forget it.
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.


I saw this movie because of my father's recommendation. It was just a dramatical movie at first. The perfect revenge and the movie which is for all of gangsters. But, when I saw this movie again, I felt some other parts. Widely, there are two themes in the movie; one is about American dream and the other one is about many life of mafia. The last son of Don Colione, Michael doesn't want to join his father's business. But, after Don got hurt by other mafia's gangsters, the Don family came to be in danger. He couldn't help but assist them. And he finally realized his destiny and his family's fate. He became the leader of the family. He was as good as his father and his cruelty was better than his father. Finally, he became the best godfather in the mafia and he lost his old shape. Michael's father, Vito shows American dream's reality in the movie. Before he dies, he grows many vegetables that he wanted. He wanted to live normally, but he became a gangster as if his son. For his death and Michael's victory between family fighting, the movie continues the darkness of the society and bad side of American dream.
Forgive me lord for it took me many days and nights to finally watch this but im glad i did this movie slaps only problem is im a gen z so i cant rate it 10/10 i hope that someday you can find solitude in knowing that.

Amazing Djdjsjdjdd Dndhjdjxjx Djxjxjxjx Dxhjxnx Atate of art Dhdjdhdj
Great storytelling, every shot mathers and is done with perfection. The devolopment of the characters is stunning, especially Michaels. Al Pacino is just as good as Marlon Brando in this masterpiece. Only to be surpassed by part 2. Which is something that usually never happens.
This is the best movie ever made, alongside with Godfather part II. I have no words to describe this, it's simply wonderful. I can't find even one little flaw. How could I? The directing by Francis Ford Coppola is the best ever done, the acting by Pacino, Brando, Duvall and the rest are astonishing. The cinematography and script couldn't be done better. This movie, if people will live in earth for many centuries, ain't never gonan be forgoten. This is something that even in the year 3002, parents must show to their children, so they'd understand what means a masterpiece. The only movie who came close to Godfather I and II is Schindler's List. So 30 years gonna and only one movie came close. The best movie ever made. 101 stars out of 100.
Akin to the world's finest wines, "The Godfather" deepens in vitality with each passing year in cinema.
The Godfather is a real masterpiece directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The screenplay, which is written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is just perfect. All the actors did their best, which actually result in memorable performances. Marlon Brando was excellent. Regardless of the fact that The Godfather was one of his first movies Al Pacino was very good. The Godfather is one of the movies that make me love the cinema.
This is the one. There is no other. No other gangster film can come close to the power that is the Godfather. The original gangster films like Public Enemy and Little Caesar can't add up to the masterpiece of the Godfather. Equal to the movie Boogie Nights, the Godfather is about family! True, you got the mob relations like Boogie Nights deals with the Porn Industry, but it has nothing to do with it. The main issue of both films is family.

The struggle of the family within the family. Watch and see how Michael runs the family different that how his father did. Watch the changing of the world as a new generation takes over. One of Coppola's best. It can never be bettered.
I cant count how many times i have watched this movie. And i love it even more with every watch. If you havent watched then youve missed a big part of film history!!

Coppola and Maria Puzo take you on a journey through the shadiness of the mafia world where we witness the greatest character arcs ever. The cinematography and camera placement of this movie are what makes it different from conventional gangster films.

I have had a distinct pleasure to have watched this picture for the first time in a 35mm screen this year in a cinema in London that shows classic films. I refrained from watching it years ago in my teenage years because my ignorant past thought this film was overrated, but honestly, there is no possible word or expression that can describe how wrong I was. The cinematography of this picture is so unheard of and monumental that every frame of this picture looks like something that could be hung as a painting in a museum. The story brings with it elements of something that came out of a Shakespearean Tragedy. I have watched it 7 times or more in a short time, and it takes A LOT to make me watch a film for a second time, let alone 7. It is one of, if not my favorite film of all time. If human civilization were to go extinct, this should be one of the few pieces of art that must survive for future intelligent lifeforms to discover and marvel at.

Like I said: Definitely not the best movie ever. While the movie had its good points, I can't see why it's number 1 on IMDB. I don't even think it was better than Goodfellas, or even better than the other two movies I rented (American History X, Casablanca). Oh well, still good entertainment, looking forward to Godfather Part II.

This was the first mafia story I saw. After watching this one, I saw other similar movies which a follow a group of mafia/criminals usually in a New York City setting, but this one still remains as my favorite. The actors are top notch, and the story is brilliant. Now, kiss my left and right cheek!

Not many films stand the test of time but after almost 50 years this is still the gold standard of cinema. And rightfully so.
THE GODFATHER is the greatest movie of all time. There is no equal to this movie. More then just a crime drama, this movie explores another type of "family".

Mario Puzo writes a fantastic tale of family honor and loyalty. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone along with Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. I loved every minute of this film.

"keep your friends close, but your enemies closer", "i'll make him an offer he can't refuse", "luca brasi sleeps with the fishes", "don't over-estimate the power of forgiveness", "if anything in this life is certain, if history's taught us anything, its that you can kill anyone" etc. These words are still in my mind.
First, I've read and heard about this movie for a looong time before I watched it, and I heard alot of people talking about how they are crazy about this film, I couldn't know why all these people are talking about this movie as it is an invention that changed the history of cinema??all of these questions in my head had stopped suddenly when I watched it , I can't think of better performance for the whole line of actors like this one, what shocked me to the depth of my heart actually is that you are confused about who is the best actor in this masterpiece?? The Don,Micheal,santino, clemenza or even Bonasera in the very iconic intro scene. The characters, the cinematography, the sound track looks fabulous . I can't really imagine how Francis Coppola managed to gather all this cast together most of them were unknown to us. This movie is really a masterpiece and it is a reference for acting, directing, writing and everything else in the cinema business.
The Godfather is a fantastic movie to watch. The story to it is just fantastic. I don't think you could beat a movie like this, but as well as the other fantastic movies, the godfather is one of the classics i think of all time. This is top of the imdb list as it's the number 1 top 250 movie at the moment, it has been for a long time and i would think it would take some beating to knock this movie off the 250 top movies list. I think that there won't be a better movie that would top the 250 best movies ever, because the godfather is an amazing movie and it is fantastic. I give this movie 10 out of 10.
I saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters. It was the first movie I seriously considered walking out of. Up to that point in my life I had never fidgeted so much in a movie. I blame the director - his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and I could hardly wait for it to be over. The whole Godfather series is vastly overrated.

The movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style. It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good.

The story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal.

It's unnecessarily violent and why did Brando put paper towel in his mouth? I mean I like him as an actor, but this character is absolutely ridiculous.

I don't understand how anyone could give an Oscar for that film! It's just stupid!
Even quite tense at times - that restaurant scene had my heart pounding, as did the hospital scene. But it is overhyped. Okay, scene composition and direction are top notch, yadda yadda, acting is phenomenal, but you can't watch it without thinking "everyone says this is the greatest film of all time". Well maybe it is for some, but the film suffers from high expectations as a consequence. Not that you, gentle reader, are interested, but I didn't rate it as highly as Apocalypse Now, Seven Samurai or even Star Wars, but it deserves a respectable 8/10 and if you haven't seen it, its worth 3 hours of your time.

Just don't believe the hype.

I don't know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I'm glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more. If you haven't watch it, what are you waiting for? ("This is an offer you can't refuse")

I love this film, great to watch, every scene is a fantastic experience Great to watch
Just watch it, if you don't like it then whatever, but worth a watch. I don't feel like explaining why.
Considered by many people (including the top 250 rank here in IMDb) as the best film in history, "The Godfather" is that kind of movie you just can't miss. Where else can we find great actors like Marlo Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan? In part II Robert De Niro enhances this trilogy even more.

The story is about Vito Corleone (Brando) who is the leader of a New York Mafia family, The Corleone, that make money with gambling.His son Michael (Pacino) doesn't feel like taking part in this life although he's often invited to by his father.

Vito Corleone has even more problems when he doesn't want to take part in drug business and when he sees that there's no one to substitute him in the family leadership.

My rate 10/10
Long and boring and not worth writing two sentences. But since I have to, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, I think you get my point!

This movie is a good one and its on the must-watch list, seriously, you must watch this :D
A mate of mine loves this film, and the whole genre to boot. He made me watch this, instilling in me the notion that it was the second best film ever, behind its sequel.

Im glad I watched it, if only to argue with my mate. This film is overrated. It's good but not good enough for a top ten spot, especially when there are better films of its genre out there. Goodfellas comes to mind, and I even found Casino more entertaining.

Basically, I like a film which leaves me thinking about it, and moved. This didn't really do either. Apparantly the sequel is better. I hope so.
I don't see what all the fuss is about surrounding this movie. It is long, slow and boring. I'm partial to the odd gangster movie (yeah, I know, this isn't a gangster movie it's a 'family' movie...*yawn*) but have seen far better than this (Carlito's Way, Mean Streets, Scarface to name a few).

Judging by the comments left on IMDB people say this movie is great due to the acting, the cinematography, the direction etc....what about the plot? The characters? Isn't that what makes a good movie? Or are the people who so verbosely extol the virtues of The Godfather all film/media students studying it for their coursework? Do people say this is a great movie because that's what they hear everyone else say?

The Godfather is not a good movie and the emperor is well and truly naked.
I've got a masters in Criminology, and have studied filmography, and I just don't get it. This isn't a great movie. The only thing that could make it a classic is the quality of the actors that were hired - and while the actors themselves can and have made quality movies, this one just doesn't do it for me. Brando didn't impress me in the least in this movie.

And as for the portrayal of organized crime - nothing personal, but if you find it attractive to honor men who not just break the law but flout the laws of civilization, then more power to you. Crime and criminals aren't glamorous - they're a sore on the backside of humanity that should be expunged.


I have seen many many movies and this is simply one of the best. My 2nd favorite film of all time. If you havent seen this film, get up and go to your local blockbuster. Forget that, just go buy it since you'll want to view it many many times. Be sure to get The Godfather Part II while you're there.
This movie is simply perfect. Whether it's the acting, scenery, pacing or anything else, it's all just so brilliantly executed. Every scene is so memorable, that I just can't think of any reason to rate this movie lower than a 10/10.
The Godfather is a great movie, which not only tells about the vendetta of the gang, but also the cruel environment of human existence. Where there are people, there are rivers and lakes.
This film is a must see for any movie fan,a true masterpiece of the American cinema
I truly don't get why people idolize it so much. A great movie? Yes. The best of all times? Never.

A cure for Insomnia, a boring movie. Not worthy of being labelled "great".
Ladies and gentlemen, if you have watched The Godfather than you have witnessed what can be called the greatest movie of all time! Simply flawless.

The Godfather aged like fine wine the older it gets the better it is.

Great plot, legendary acting and directing, violent, bold and no gangster movie is as nearly as good as The Godfather. The Italians sure know how to make great gangster movie. This movie proved to everyone that Marlon Brando is the best actor in the world and started the career of the legendary Al Pacino, this says something. If you are starving for greatness watch The Godfather it is nothing less than a masterpiece and if you have seen it, take a bow!

Never understood the hype, until I took the time to watch the entire series throughout. This movie is simply incredible. From the storyline, to the filming, the composition, theme tune - everything hits hard.

A must watch for any true movie fan.



This is over done and over rated. It sucks.

It just doesn't make any sense why people like one crime film so much. There are so many good motion pictures out there, and out of all of them, people pick this one? Honestly Francis Ford Coppola is over rated, and he makes lots of trash films.
Quite possibly the MOST over rated film in history. Never has there been so much made of so little. It is an OK movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of "gang" lifestyle. This movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot.

Do you know what the saddest part of this movie is? That it was remade two more times with the Godfather III being quite possible the worst remake EVER. I'm not saying you won't like the movie. It is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie. I just can't stand when movies can't stand up to their own hype.
I cannot add anymore superlatives to the previous comments from IMDb subscribers. This movie is the greatest. I read the book twice before seeing the film. The first time for the pure enjoyment of the marvelous storyline & dialogue. The second time to reflect on Vito and Michael Corleone's management abilities. Are they not CEOs?

The movie - it's breathtaking. I own the entire series and watch it whenever time allows. Unfortunately I can rarely afford the six hours necessary to do so.
What could I possibly say that has not been said about the Godfather that has not already been said because there has not been a better film. There has been comparable films in my opinion but it is in that elite class. No other movie could excite me thinking about it, like this one, The character studies were amazing, Some of the greatest characters ever. The direction,score was Amazing. Al Pacino secured his place in history thanks to this movie, a Perfect 10, whoever said this movie was bad, I don't see how anyone could respect their opinions about anything.
This is more a comment on the comments then on the movie. The movie was so well made, great story telling, great acting, and a vivid look at a time gone by in American history. What is really funny is that reading the comments you find two or three people that say this movie was junk. To say it is not the best of all time is one thing, I like Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia better myself, but to say that this was a bad movie is unthinkable. But that is what makes this web site so much fun. Everyone can voice their opinion.
#1 movie of all time. Absolute Absolute Best.

Watched the 50th anniversary edition on a super screen and walked away (again!!) astonished.

Superlative craft in every aspect of movie making.

Only thought was to go home and watch the next two editions.

Pilgrimage of movies starts with Godfather!!
You want story? You got it. You want characters? You got it. You want intrigue and movement and music and gala? You got it. This is the template for how movies should be made. You love/hate the people. You feel their lives. You believe and cast aside doubt. You get wrapped up in the thing. This is what a movie is supposed to do.

It's more than a mafia movie, it's a movie about family and loyalty, about love and determination. There is no comic relief, except Luca testing his devotion to the Don, and then tragedy. Yes, a very tragic movie but very well done. There are triumphs. There are falls. All very well mixed and very well done. Excellent work done on the costume and general set work. It draws you into the time and place, as a good movie should. No cheap shots, no pandering. Just very good cinema. Bravo.
The Godfather is truly an excellent film with a sensational cast, genius writing, and direction. Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again.
This is the movie that I use as a reference for all others to understand the best elements of Film.

When I mention world building, editing, cinematography, directing, atmosphere, characterization and they don't understand, I refer them to the titan of all films. The Godfather is that film.

While not a horror movie, the scene with the horse head in the beginning of the film pushed me to pursuing my passion for horror films.

If you want to begin watching movies as a hobby and really understand the art form, please watch the godfather. It will not dissapoint.
I've watch this film trilogy but do not understand what all the fuss is about! There is nothing amazing or special this and I feel like I wasted time. I don't understand how it won Oscars either!
much has been said about how great this film is,and i hesitated for the longest time before breaking down,but finally i bought the Restoration Box set which contains the three films and two bonus discs.so,after watching this first film,i must say i was pretty impressed.it's a well crafted film.at a running time of just over one hundred and seventy three minutes,you'd never know it.there never a dull moment.it's exceptionally engrossing from the opening frame to the closing credits.the acting is superb.Marlon Brandon is excellent,but i would say that a young Al Pacino matches him.the dialogue is also well written.for me,The Godfather is a 10/10

One of the classic movies and one of my favorites movie of all time is "The Godfather". It is a movie that show us how are the things in mafia from an inside look. In this movie you will understand how things work in mafia and which is the followed hierarchy.

Marlon Brando made on of his best performances of his entire career as Don Vito Corleone and it seemed as he had won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1973. You will also love the performance of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (Nominated for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role).

"The Godfather" is a movie that you must see and I strongly recommend it to you and I am sure that you will rate it with a 10/10.

This is one of very few movies that shook the film industry !!
The only people who could give to this film a note over 1, are people who have never watched too many films(like my father,he says it's a masterpiece, but he don't like cinema, he just repeats what most people say), as a cinephile, this film has a lot of failures, and obviously not the best film in its genre, and it can't have this rank just because "it shows how italian family and organized crime is", that's a silly and empty argument, you people got to have better arguments TO RANK A FILM! more knowledge, watch more movies, study cinema history and cinema production!!! you can't give this film a 10 just because "it's a classic" or because "everyone has heard about this film", JUST DON'T, the people who liked this or call it a masterpiece, with all the respect, are people who don't like cinema too much or don't know much about it, sorry, but that is a fact.It's a good film, but compared to he thousands of films ever made, it's one of the worst.
2/3 - acting 1/3 - storyline 1/3 - cinematic.

Start of really good and I lose interest in around 1/4 part of the movie, and completely disappointed. If you like movie like selling drugs and more actions I think it is not for you or indeed I'm really not into action movies.

From the opening credits, you become completely immersed in the world of the Godfather. One of this film's greatest strengths is the pure power of the culture surrounding it. When you watch it, you feel like the society and the people in have descended from generations of people who have been in the "business".

The acting is nothing less than sensational and the music accentuates and complements the film beautifully.

Not much else can be said of perfection.

This film is a must-have for anyone who professes to watch movies and is a required viewing for cultural education.
This movie is one of thé best pièce of art in thé history of humanity
It absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel.

This is without a doubt the best film ever made (at least that I have seen) not only because all of the graphic violence in it is used sparingly yet compels because it is edited to be kept realistic, but also because not a single scene is dumb or pointless.
A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo's "The Godfather" is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale's head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where "The Turk"(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it'll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal. Rating 5 stars!
It's everything I ever wanted it to be based on extremely high reviews and my expectation.

The acting is incredible. The character development is fascinating to watch. Twists, turns, amazing dialogue and memorable moments.

It might be long, but not at any point did I think of taking a break. Simply stunning.
A must watch for all film enthusiasts and lovers. The acting, story, the direction it's extraordinary and the movie is released in 1972 that's remarkable.


Cant believe this movie is from 1970s. Its the first time i gave a movie 10/10. Easily this could be the best Movie in the history of Hollywood.

The Best Movie of All times, Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are Superb. Al Pacino as the son of the Godfather rules the second half of the movie with its excellent histronics and style. How The ruthless Michael conquers the underworld empire is perhaps the most significant tales of ever times. GodFather II equally good but III simply disappoints.
If there were one film that I would say you should watch before you die, it is this one. This is the definition of a perfect film. Every aspect of it is brilliant and amazing. The acting, the story, the filmmaking, everything is incredible.

I read someone's comment saying that the movie lacked emotion. Now, I don't agree at all, I love the movie and wouldn't dare to criticise it like that. But after giving it some good thought, I can see what he or she meant with that comment. And it can be easily helped! Watch the other two as well! If you watch the three movies, preferably with no more than a day between them, you WILL feel emotion. It's a long story about people and if you allow yourself to feel for these people, when you get to know them, than you can't be left untouched. At least I personally can't imagine anyone not being touched. The story's so good, the acting is amazing, the movie is incredibly well made and the music is beautiful. So please, people, if you hated the first one, give it another try! Watch it again and watch the others as well. You'll thank me later :) ...
The gangster genre is a American as apple pie. We have had a love affair with mobsters. From James Cagney , Edward G. Robinson etc We Love the Mob. The Godfather is nothing different. It is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made. The story is a rags to riches story of a crime family that stared out with nothing then rose to the most powerful crime family. What I love more then that, Is the character development especially with Micheal from a war hero to a cold blooded boss. It is the story of a family that faces challenges from both outside and inside the family.

If you haven't seen this epic. Then please do your self a favor and watch this masterpieces. You won't be sorry.

American as apple pie
The Godfather since 1972, has been called the greatest movie of all time. Nothing is perfect in life, but The Godfather gives a new meaning to the word perfection
This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in "The Godfather".

They say lighting never strikes twice and, while I hope that it isn't true in film as it isn't true in nature, I don't know that we'll ever see a movie up to the caliber of The Godfather again. The writing, directing, acting, soundtrack, cinematography....everything about the film is an A+. I've seen it so many times and I'm such a movie buff that I've made it my life's goal to actually FIND a flaw with the film, but I always come up empty. I've heard the runtime criticized, but there are no superfluous parts to the movie that deserve cutting. I can only hope that we someday see a film that measures up, but won't hold my breath. Bravo.
Really like this one. Must watch for any fans off mafia films. Will watch again.

Marlon Brando's One Man Show. Best Direction And Screenplay. Al Pacino's Performance at his Best. Best Gangster Movie Ever.
A classy story of italian crime family "corleone", story rolls around the family head vito corleone who is now not as powerful as used to be and so the son michael corleone jumps in the family business to bind the scattered things once again ! A complete crime drama, filled with music, classy dialouges and character that cannot be find in any other movie !

Rarely has a sequel been better than the original and in this case that is saying a lot. The Godfather 2 has Francis Ford Coppola bettering his original film which is such a tall task seeing as The Godfather was already so well received upon release. All emotions one can find in a life are presented here. Al Pacino is absolutely sublime as Michael Corleone who has taken over the business and family even though he is young. All the actors are so good you cannot fathom anyone else in their roles. The cinematography is exquisite and the direction so good it makes you wonder what happened to Coppola come the 80s. This is a must watch for any person who appreciates cinema.

Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.

**** (out of four)

This movies is pure class. I only am going to say you must whach it.
Don Vito Corleone: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Don Vito Corleone: Revenge is a dish best served cold. Don Vito Corleone: "A friend should always underestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults
For me The Godfather is the best film. Everything from the music to acting and script are all perfect. The film has tons of amazing iconic lines and scenes and of course the character of Vito Corleone is amazing and Marlon Brando does an amazing job of playing him. Everything about the film is perfect.
This is one of my favorite movies. A very good cast which includes Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and many more. I was very moved by this story. It is a very believable movie. It's gotta be one of the best movies ever made.
Definitely the most overrated movie ever. It's not bad but it's pretty slow. I've tried and failed to make it all the through it many times but I always fall asleep. Perfect example of a classic that's surviving on nostalgia. I'm sure for it's time it was revolutionary. Reminds me of when older folks talk about their favorite athletes from the past. Sure some of them are all time greats but let's be honest most of them just can't keep up with modern times. I'm 34 years old for reference in case I come off sounding like a child.
Superb movie i remember i watched when i was in college.
Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as "Gone with the Wind", "Casablanca", or "Lawrence of Arabia". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like "Indiana Jones" and "National Treasure" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film.
I can't really describe accurately how I feel about this movie. I have seen it so many times and every time I have enjoyed it more than the previous one. The plot, the music, the actors and actresses couldn't have played better roles. This movie was even better than the book which rarely happens in with other movies. No wonder why it movie has been ranked first.
When you see it on TV, you get the offer you can't refuse. Godfather is the greatest movie ever. Acting, music, directing, photography, everything is perfect. Movie without a mistake. Real masterpiece.

Francis Ford Coppola's first film in the series is still an epic, full of hypnotic acting, which reinvented mafia criminals as players in a dynastic psychodrama. This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks and he sees no other ways than to step in and fight for his family; if you watched Scarface and you liked Tony Montana, than you'd like Michael as well. This is a masterpiece and I think everyone would love Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone making the story so good.
This film shows an Italian Mafia Carleone headed by Don Vito, The Godfather. You are lucky if he is your friend, but if he is your enemy then you are dead. The film starts with his daughter's wedding introducing all other characters. Here comes our main lead Micheal who is a simple guy who doesn't want to get involved in the family business. There are other Mafia families equally powerful to Don Vito's family. One guy Sollozzo, who wants to start his drug business under the protection of Godfather. But Don Vito who is a good mafia rejects this deal as drug business is against his principles. This act of rejection starts a gang war among mafia families involving great atrocities which affects even the Corleone family. Micheal also gets involved in this war due to family emotions and other reasons. This movie is a great piece of art with great acting, action, drama and with spices of surprises.
Could not recommend higher. Does not matter your age, background, etc. And it is not nearly as long as I expected. Sonny as a character and James Cann performance are terrific and reason enough to watch it. Al Pacino is terrific. Duvall an Brando are great.
The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. Marlon Brando gives a powerful performance as Don Corleone along with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Talia Shire. It shows the brutal strength of the mob and how they controlled things back in the day. It is truly an American classic and is hardly considered a dissappointment to many fans. The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants. Marlon Brando's performance was so superb that he won an Oscar for it. I loved this movie! If you are any movie fanatic, you should see this movie before any other.

The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.
This is more than a gangster movie this is a pure masterpiece.
I'm glad there are a few voices of dissent within all of the gushing

hype listed here. Do the fans of this movie rate "Citizen Kane" as

the 2nd best film of all time? Then maybe listen to the Beatles and

Elvis Presley as the greatest music of all time? Is America under

some kind of cultural mass-hypnosis?

Grossly overrated on all counts.
The Godfather is definitely one of the best films ever made. There is great acting ,and a truly great story which is very entertaining. It is exciting to watch and even if you do not like crime or criminals you will somehow like the ones in this movie. I JUST CAN"T PUT THE GREATNESS OF THIS MOVIE INTO WORDS!
I've stopped watching 4 different times after the first 30mins but later one day i've decided to finish it because I've never heard great things about a film like this then happened to watch I was totally mindblown and got to know why this film is undisputed inspiration for 100's of films even after 40years of its release. It's a character driven film more than a plot driven film that's why we feel unsettling while watching the first 1 hour but as long as you travel with the characters and their emotions you can feel the magic. Can't thank enough the cast and crew for this greatest cinematic experience, I wish every movie buff will check out this film to witness how a grand masterpiece can influence their work.
If only this film was not supposed to be the greatest movie ever made...

Had an interesting start. But then it took too long for me to get invested in the characters. And it kind of tries to glorify crime and criminals.

So yeah this movie needs lots of patience. Maybe when it was made it was different and trendsetter.

Oh. The expectations.

WILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIEWILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIEWILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIE.

The Godfather deserves all the love it gets with its fantastic acting, story, suspense, character development, music, and direction. This is the highest standard of film making, Francis Ford Coppola was a genius with his direction in this one and the second. This is a gangster film like no other, the perfect combination. Its like having your favorite food at your favorite restaurant in your favorite city, everything is perfect, from the front and center details to the small and minor ones.
This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes.

Powerful acting, amazing portrayal of the mafia, outstanding script, this movie has it all
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 49 years old and has aged well. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic.
The Godfather is probably the most overrated movies of all time. I don't see why everyone gives this movie such a high rating. The movie sucks. The movie is just so darn boring and the only reason I kept watching it was because I kept wanting it to get better. I know a movie is not all about action, but come on, who wants to watch a movie that is just all talk and no action. Look at Scarface and The Untouchables, those were good Mafia movies. They both had a great storyline, great acting, and had at least some action. The Godfather is just way to boring and I don't get why it is number on the all time list. Some reviews that didn't like this movie have said many people like this movie because its about the Mafia and its influence. Those people who have said that are absolutely right. The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's performances were pretty darn good, but the story itself which carry's the movie is just so darn boring and this is without a doubt the most overrated movie ever. I'll stick to the Star Wars Saga instead of the Godfather Trilogy.
The Godfather is the best movie of all time because this movie got the most splendid crew. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola (Director), Mario Puzo, the author of the book "The Godfather" on which the movie is based on, Nino Rota (composer). This is a TRUE MAFIA FAMILY drama movie. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of Italian art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of movies, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Pacino's raspy pseudo- whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.
THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies is an understatement for the line 'THE GODFATHER of all movies'. You won't miss any element of a great movie in this. Two greatest actors from Hollywood (Brando & Pacino) and a director whose fame is worldwide. The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English.

There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now.
Greatest Movie of all time. Always have to stop and watch when it's on.

I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.

However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.

Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind. I get so sick of movies that have that 'Stephen King Fizzle' nowadays!
After all the hype people have given this movie and the fact it won Best Picture confuses me.

Most of it was just people sitting around talking. There were some good actiony scenes but they are few and far between, aside from Sonny's sister flipping her lid and smashing up the house, followed by the famous tollbooth scene a few minutes later.

Speaking of the house-smashing scene, it's meant to be dramatic but I burst out laughing, but that's just my morbid sense of humor.

Maybe I'm just not "getting it" and my head is up where the sun doesn't shine, but this movie was just...... kinda boring for me.
It's a movie from which I have learned many things about life.
There is no movie quite like The Godfather. It was the movie that gave me a true respect for film and motivated me to seek out something else over those few family friendly flicks I'd see twice a year at the theater. Now I watch nearly a hundred every year and yet I've never found anything quite like this masterpiece. It's the type you can watch over and over again and somehow find new things that make you respect the film even more. It's really an experience to watch and everyone should see it at some point in their lives.
I was surprised looking at my voting history that I had not voted for this one before. Though not my number one it is one of the top ten ever made. The acting is outstanding. Young Pacino was at his very best. I don't want to start naming the actors, because all of them put in their best performance. Few men and women that had appeared in this production had ever made a more impressive performance. If there is any fault with the movie it would be the violence. I don't think that the subject could be relayed with any less and still depict the type of people being presented. The scene with the horse in the producers bed is gruesome, but the subjects are of that caliber. It is one of those movies that has to be seen at least once if for no other reason than because it truly is one of the best films ever made.


what can i say, this film is magnificent. everything about it is flawless. i must admit, however, that i am partial to mafia pictures, but that doesn't matter. i'm serious when i say it's a great film. if you haven't seen it yet, please do so as soon as possible. thank you.
What impress me most of Godfather At the wedding, I remembered, after telling the story of his family, Michael said to his girlfriend: "that's my family, Kay. It's not me." However, at the end of movie, he closed the door to let Kay outside.
Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect
The Godfather is the best movie of all time. It was made so great, with great plot, with a lot of suspense, and great acting. This movie in my opinion has had the best cast ever-- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. If you haven't watched this yet, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse! WATCH IT!
It's still one of the most iconic films today.

And it's fun for modern people to!

So you can watch it with every friend you want.
This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The perfects book's perfect adaptation. The only minor "problem" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits. In the lead role Al Pacino was the best choice, and don't forget to mention the legend, Marlon Brando as THE Godfather. I think this film represents what nowadays movie are lack of. In this movie the story and the characters are the main parts not the visual effects. In my opinion to this very day, this was Coppola's best directing. And don't forget Nino Rota's melodies which are inseparable from the movie.
Maybe it's a generational thing, or I simply just don't get it, but The Godfather was bland and boring from start to finish. The story is hard to follow and lost me several times along the way. I felt emotionally disconnected from the movie and constantly found myself checking how long was left. Although the acting can be very good in some parts, the acting in other parts is downright terrible. It does not live up to the hype, for me.
I think this is the best film ever done. All the actors did so well in the film..Specially Brando and Al Pacino won my heart.. I can see more than 100 times and still not boar.
This is probably the best mob movie of all time which captures the old mob dramatics of the 1920-30s with the more business savvy mobs of the 1950-60s. It links the classic capones with the modern gambinos.

Al Pacino's finest silent work ever. With simple looks he envy's so much meaning. Brando at the best i have ever scene. The ensemble is absolutely amazing. This is the best of the 3, and miles above part 2 (which i like but don't think quite matches up this part 1 in anyway)

If you haven't watched this, rent the DVD and watch it this weekend. If you have and don't have the DVD collection, buy it.

IT is worth preserving this and having it in good quality.
It is no wonder that the milestone tamil movies like Pudhupettai & Chekka Chivantha Vaanam were heavily inspired from it. The movie starts with an astounding performance of a guy who later is magnified with few events/dialogues and gets introduced to us as a Gangster/Don/GodFather, although the movie feels more dramatic with a whole lot of family/dramatic scenes, it never keeps us unengaged and later when the unexpected hierarchy of kid gets to pick up the left overs by the big guy with a parallel eventful formation of a new don built upon the legacy of it as the climax forms the crux for its series as a whole.
My mate Leigh hasn't seen this film. I was a bit confused when he told me like but I thought I'd drop his review on anyhow. Leigh isn't gonna watch this film because everyone sez he should, but he's from Yorkshire and them lot are reyt stubborn.

Anyhow, it's an alright film about some lads who do some stuff, some of em die, some of em don't. But I suppose that's just life really.
It took me about three viewings to appreciate this movie, saw it for the first time when i was about 12 years old and found it boring and couldnt understand the plot. Now that i saw it again a bit older i truly understand why this is touted as probably the best film ever.

Nothing i could write hasnt already been written before, but when the only flaw i can find in this movie is a bad overdub - "I talked to Barzini!" - then this truly is a cinematic masterpiece.
Not worth to present in top 10 Popular Movie, yesss i know it's Impossible to ignore the performance and evaluation of characters via marlon Brandon and Al pacino Both are Incredible actors, but the long period of movie is boring, there is a lot of Scenes Not important.
It captures a dark world,at it's darkest and most violent,yet there are moments of beauty sprinkled throughout.This is what I enjoyed about The Godfather.I'm not a huge fan of mafia themed films,but I will give this film credit for presenting it with such realism.We get lost in it's realities and we forget often throughout the film that it is,in fact just a movie and that it is all play acting.I was wowed by how well casted it was and how well suited for their characters each actor was,in particular Marlon Brando.For all of it's dark theme and violent content,The Godfather still manages to come out looking like a true masterpiece.
This film has everything - Great actors at the top of their game, a brilliant and realistic story, a top director, brilliant cinematography, wonderfully evocative post war costumes and cars, brilliant scenes (horses head, restaurant shooting scene, hospital scene etc.) and a score that adds to the film without overpowering it. At first look it would seem to be a film about a family of gangsters, but I think that what it really is is a story of how a good, intelligent man, a war hero, can become a monster by degrees. Godfather II is probably superior but it couldn't have been made without this film. A true masterpiece.
Story about a man, who is a gangster, and his relationship with family, encounters, businesses and many more. Nevertheless, despite being filmed fairly long ago, the movie is genuinely enjoyable and has very few boring parts.
The only good thing about the movie was its style. It is unique. The second thing was Al Pacino, I mean he just holds everything still while he speaks. REally commendable performance. The opening scene was fantastic"I believe in America" perfectly lit shot. After that everything is a drag. I get bored by the end of the movie. It has elongated scenes , I mean these so elongated that you can take a nap without missing anything. It was more like a opera kind of movie. So the opera lovers may like this movie but for me it was boring. Go watch it if you kind of love family drama said in a kind of some song and well love to nourish the scenes

It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, "The Godfather" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. "The Godfather" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.

You can't miss this movie.
'The Godfather' remains compelling viewing after all these years. Directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola, the film shows the control of a mafia family passing from Marlon Brando to his reluctant son Al Pacino. The opening segment is brilliant as it introduces all the main characters. The acting is superb across the board with Brando winning a richly deserved Best Actor Oscar for his highly nuanced portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. Pacino gives an understated performance with sudden intense outbursts. The film is very violent but remains hugely influential. One of the all time greats.

Overall 10/10
I remember I watched this as a kid. I am thankful for that. This is a great film with a tone reminiscent of other great films. The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off. The cinematography is stark and bare. In the bundle of all that it lacks, I feel that the movie is ignored for its writing. Quality work that draws you in and doesn't let you go. I suggest this movie to everyone. This is actually a serious movie with a serious message. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. I like this type of film, as it reminds me of German movies where it's more about the characters and their environment. Final rating from me: seven out of ten, almost eight out of ten.
I find it troubling that this is apparently a popular movie. The characters are all bad people - immoral, completely lost. Are we supposed to like them? I'm shaking my head thinking about it. It's also pretty slow. Lots of slow, quiet talk punctuated by random violence. If this is your sort of thing, well . . seek help. At least it's not propaganda like a Disney movie, or most Hollywood movies today for that matter.

Although many films about gangsters preceded The Godfather, the way Coppola presented the Corleone family , and his portrayal of mobsters as characters of considerable psychological depth and complexity was something new.

This film is the definition of classic. There are countless movies that in their script are mentioning ...this one! That says a lot.

It affect movies, TV series, books, comics, animations, even video games.

The dark drama and the struggle...the pain actually.

Anyway you don't wanna miss this one and IMO it is better if you see the complete trilogy one after the other.
We all know what a wonderful movie this is. I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film.


This film has made me appreciate being Italian so much more.
Godfather is a one of a kind film. Nothing can ever beat this kind of story, with the Mafia and organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola just makes an amazing story like this come alive. It was made so that Francis could keep his studio running, Zoetrope, and probably didn't intend for it to be such a masterpiece it is. It's complete genius. Marlon Brando as the Godfather who gets a kiss on his hand and being told who should be killed, and getting lots of friendship from different people. Al Pacino, who is one of the most important actors of all time, is one of his sons, who is in the army, and not really into the family crime business unto soon enough. And other characters who make the Corleone family a one-in-a-million family, with astute heads. This is probably the, or probably one of my favorite movies of all time, just because it works, and is directed professionally, and perfectly. The acting puts a whole other atmosphere into this film. Watch it, and be sure to watch the second one also.
Sometimes, I feel the movie goes over my head, but even with my pedestrian tastes, I can see the greatness of the film.

What can you say about a movie that has so many great and popular dialogue? A film that has a famous character. A film that is so powerful, moving, brilliant, innovative, and stunning?

Just one word: MASTERPIECE!

The Godfather is easily one of the greatest movies ever made! This movie is definitely in my top ten. Next to films like "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly," "Young Frankenstein," "Goldfinger," and "The Godfather, Part II." This film like so many other classics has great direction, story line, character development, outstanding acting, and a great score.

****out of****stars

I watched the DVD recently because everyone seems to be hyped about this 'greatest movie on earth'!! Well, I wouldn't waste your valuable time any further writing a lot here after wasting my good 3 hours watching so called God Father. I nearly died of boredom. Simply, this is one of the most boring, longest movies I have ever watched. And it is horrible! Is it a great story? No. Is it a great movie? NOT AT ALL!! It is just a welded work of so many boring, long celluloid pieces together. There is no stature, depth, matter or even an exciting plot. After all, Brando is a good actor but not that great in this one for sure. And I am still at a loss to understand why people give this rut 9.2!! It would of course be totally right just without the 9!





The Godfather is truly the godfather of movies. Whether its the acting, the music, the cast, screenplay...everything is spot on and credit to Francis Ford Coppola for not only directing this but also choosing to stick with a new comer like Al Pacino where as the production wanted a household name, casting Brando and setting the story in New York despite being nearly fired on 3-4 occasions. And boy did it pay off, They would go on to earn their own Oscar nominations and wins for "The Godfather." The movie is.3 hours long & slow paced but still there is no dull moment in the movie. A treat for movie lovers with legends of cinema.
Before i fell asleep i was extremely bored. couldn't tell you what the plot is whatsoever.
First time i saw this movie i did not understand the actual realty of movie and characters acting was speech less. Rest i can said when i saw and understand this movie after my 5th 100% successful attempt to watch full movie then i realize this was the awesome movie i need to buy original, and well be in my personal collection . Currently my family and my friends also buy the original blue ray of this movie very hard to find a seller because all want this one to their collection part.

fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters am speechless. We all knows we well not again see to like this kind of level of movie in any decades hats off to all super actors in the movie.
This film leaves one big question behind: Why the hell is it rated no.1 in IMDb?? There is no basic storyline, sometimes some people are being murdered but nobody knows why, you can't even say if the acting is good or bad because they run around with hats and sad faces all the time.

From the beginning you simply sit there, waiting for some kind of message or at least some sense - and then after a much too long time the film is over. Why did they kill Don's friend? Why did they try to kill Don? Why did their enemies know that his son was driving to the husband of his sister? Where from did they know the one of the sons was in Italy? Why do they kill all the time at all? And where is the police I was wondering all the film. Lots and lots of murders, no police. Hm. It's nothing more than a bad 70's Mafia-trash-film.
I re-watched it today. My rating reflects that I feel it is over long, and not as vital as it may have seemed to audiences in 1972. Parts of it, in fact, are actually boring. Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir.
This movie for good reason is regarded along with its sequel (which I think is a better film) as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. The mark it has left on society, especially the male psyche can never be underestimated or for that matter fully gauged. All actors turn in career defining performances and the overall "feel" of the movie is such that you feel for characters that in reality you would have every right to loathe. Not much can be written that has not already been said so just a quick reminder for that person out there who has not yet seen or heard of the Godfather to rent out an absolute classic.
As a young cinephile I am amazed that there is a movie like this one.Never seen such amazing acting done by Legend Marlon Brando 🔥🔥🔥🔥.My favourite is Al Pacino⚡⚡⚡ as Michael Corleone.That transformation from a simpleton to a beast💟💟💟💟
One of the greatest stories ever told through film. From the cinematography to the cast there isn't a single flaw.The performance by Marlon Brando is just stunning and Al Pacino amazes with his talent with this being one of his first movies. The legacy of this movie and the way it has affected cinema cant be described in words. Being a fan of organized crime movies I can say that this is my absolute favorite and I cant remember how many times I have watched it.It might be a bit long but It never ceases to amaze the viewer with its brilliant dialogue and excellent cinematography.I would like to thank personally everyone who worked on this achievement of a film. A must see for everyone who has even the slightest appreciation for cinema!!!
Greatest movie of all time no doubt. Perfect 10. Every aspect of this masterpiece is exceptional, starting from the cast and screenplay up until the production.
This movie was probably relevant in the 70s and may have been a benchmark at the time it was made. Watching it in 2006, I can see how it added to the movie landscape and that effect that it had on subsequent film making.

Some of the film is amazing, but mostly it goes on and on. It is very long, with some of the scenes taking an age, without really adding to the atmosphere or the point. These are not impressive pauses, silences, looks, stares, or useful dwelling time, simply editing that never happened.

This film is worth seeing as a history lesson in film, to get an understanding of the development of the genre, but anybody who has seen goodfellas, casino, or any other mob flick is unlikely to find the moral tale worth the journey.
This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays.
This film is amazing. I watched in my childhood and still.
One of the most perfect films of all time. This movie is a must watch and a must watch again. It captures society in the mafia era in the United States. The main thematic conflict is between good and evil and the decent to the dark side for the main character Michael. The movie has a great dichotomy between the purity of religion and crime. Francis Ford Copolla has directed a master piece in this first of the trilogy.
Overrated movie that romanticizes the mafia. Script is average, the performances and scenography are good, but they don't wash away the weak script. Don Vito Corleone is just a romanticized and unbelievable mob boss.
The movie follows the rise (or fall, depending on your perspective) of the son of a crime family boss.

It's a relatively enjoyable long a drawn out movie. Though it moves at a fairly slow pace, it keeps the viewer engaged. I can see why it is so beloved - it features carefully crafted characters with detailed character arcs. However, I don't find it as engaging, or re-watchable, as contemporary films.

It's worth a watch, after all, it's consider on of the pinnacles of movie making, but I can't say it's for everyone.
A ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes. After about 20 minutes of this tripe I wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them -- for the good of humanity. With few exceptions (Pacino) the acting was also of low caliber. All the money spent on the sets, costumes, and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storyline.
The acting and story telling is so powerful thanks to the teaming of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his novel). Marlon Brando is the Oscar-winning titled patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, who struggles to keep his family together. Oscar-nominated Al Pacino is the son Michael, who eventually takes his father's place. Let's not forget the supporting performances of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire. This is a really perfect movie about the mafia that does everything in their power to stay on top. Not to be missed, but if you can't say anything nice about "The Godfather," then don't say anything at all. My evaluation: **** out of ****.


Truly one of the best movie series in the world. Great quality acting and script... It's impossible to forget. This will never happen again. Don Vito Corleone.
Francis Ford Coppola's version of the Mario Puzo best seller is simply perfect. It is without a doubt the best American Film of all time. If you have never seen The Godfather, and you appreciate great movies, then go out and purchase it. This movie should not even be available for rent because it should be in everyone's movie library.

This is a movie with the most ultimate character development. Each scene makes the next one better. The restaurant scene was one of the most tense scenes in cinema history. This isn't just a gangster film; it's a film about cause and effect, what would, could and should be. It's action scenes are a bit dated now, but the directing was masterful here. In my opinion, it's better than the sequel.
I love Al Pacino Movie. The Godfather is the world's greatest movie and Marlon Brando was great actor I love his acting and Soundtrack is so great and beautiful.
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent amusement, and over the top commanding. It's hard to fine a movie done this well, it's 29 times old and has progressed well. Indeed if the bystander doesn't like cabal type of pictures, he or she'll watch the entire film, the cult is fused to what will be next as the film progresses. Its about, family, fidelity, rapacity, connections, and real life. This is a great blend, and the cultural style make the film memorable.
I have watched this film so many times now and I never for once got tired of watching it.

It's always amongst the first top 10 on the list of the all time great movies.
Unlike a lot of older movies, The Godfather is packed with action and plot. The plot moves at lightening speed - honestly my only critique is that it moves TOO fast! Great characters, interesting plot, lots of action. While there is a small amount of racism and the entire movie is male focused, The Godfather holds up relatively well for its age.
Francis Coppola's best film that deserved more than it's 3 Oscars (especially with CABARET winning 8 that year). James Caan is feisty, belligerent and passionate as Sonny, Al Pacino is introspective and brooding as young Michael, John Cazale is awkward and insecure as Fredo, Robert Duvall in quietly intelligent,and Brando kicks butt in one of his finest characters. A wonderful supporting cast, especially Sterling Hayden, Talia Shire and Richard Castellano.

Nobody expected much from this adaptation of Mario Puzo's pulp novel, but it was worth all the trouble Francis went through (hiring Brando and Pacino, not filming in St. Louis..etc.etc). Brilliant cinematography by the "Prince of Darkness" Gordon Willis, great music by Nino Rota, and a great family American tale of loyalty, business, and capitalism. A 10 out of 10!
Overrated movie. not even in my top 1000 movie. I feelt so sleeping while watchin it and felt that I just wasted two hours watching it and decided to stop
I have actually already posted a review of The Godfather but my ID was erased for some reason (emfern13). So on with the review. The Godfather is the best Mafia film ever made and also the best film ever made period. The acting is fantastic. Marlon Brando is brillianty as Vito Corleone aka The Godfather. Al Pacino is great as Michael but why is he a Supporting Role? James Caan is excellent, a standout performance as the hot tempered Santino.

The acting is also helped by a fantastic script and masterful direction. 10 out of 10.
Vito Corleone. He is the Don of the notorious Corleone crime family and has ruled among the other 5 families of crime. When the Don is critically wounded in a mob hit, Vito's only son who hasn't gotten into the business begins to take over.

A very in-depth, masterfully told saga of the mafia with an all-star cast: Marlon Brando as The wise Vito, Al Pacino the innocent son who loses his innocence inside business, James Caan the hot headed brother of Pacino who wants his sister to be safe, Robert Duvall the half brother atourney who looks out from all the financial angles. These and many other fine actors create the perfect cast for such a fantastic movie.

The film excels in everything. Violence as well, so viewers be warned.

Strongly recommended ****/****
"The Godfather" has become a classic in the 28 years since its release. It's definitely a great movie, that hasn't lost any of it's brilliance. The problems of Don Vito's life are still strong today, especially the issue of drugs.

Marlon Brando gives an Oscar-winning performance as the patriarch of a Mafia family, Don Vito Corleone. There are also incredible performances by Al Pacino and James Caan, who play Corleone's two sons, Michael and Sonny. Diane Keaton also gave a magnificent performance as Kay.

Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor Marlon Brando (although he refused to accept it because of the discrimination against Indians), "The Godfather" has become a staple in my house. I think it's a movie that everyone should see, and I think many people will agree. Therefore, I give this flawless work a 10.
forced to sit through this шit so many times by idiots extolling its virtues. i wish it was never made. I'm sick of mafia films and this dross started it all, moody, violent, miserable, and as intelligent as football and drinking. too many idiots today actually believe they are mafia because they sell some pot, or bought a dog that they beat until it turned nasty. grow up and bin this film. wooden acting throughout this title has set the bar for gangster films, and of course gangsters are not known for flair or intelligence when a beating or a bullet appears to cure all ills. the film is not a pleasure to watch, nor could i be less interested in the story of this mediocre family squabble. OK so this is my least favourite genre but it set that level. i urge anyone who hates this film to review it here and bring it down in the rankings to a reasonable 1-3 because the 10/10 that thousands of morons gave this is unreal.
It's a great film in the history of film. Such a well sculpted film- making. Must watch to experience the true art of film. What I loved about it was the story telling, not exaggerating the crimes, taking the tones seriously and the artful cinematography. Marlon Brando again defined acting and the range of acting. Al Pacino became a star through this film for his extravagant and powerful performance. The production was so neat, the timing of the dialogue. It lives up to the expectation of Mario Puzo's novel. Some of the scenes were so real and eye-opening. It really explores thorough the darkness of human behavior. This is a "MUST SEE" movie don't miss it.
This movie, about the aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty in postwar New York City who transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant youngest son, brings fantastic qualities when it comes to the acting and the cinematography. Very realistic and stunning! The general life and relationships of the characters felt so real, and the production design was perfect. Can't avoid to mention the action and its practical effects. Very professional! I had a nice time watching this, but my main critic is the pace and the length. It was sometimes bland and boring, because I think there were too many scenes, or some of them too long. Some scenes could have been deleted or shortened without making any major differences on the movie. Anyway, a good movie overall, and therefore recommended!

I expected a lot of this film especially after this was ranked as one of the best films. But to give it #1 ranking is way too much. I watched it and it was an OK film. The portrayal was real but a little too slow at times. Reality they say bites and I guess it was more like a documovie that chronicles the life of a mafia and his family. Facts were not the problem here, the speed was. I could find little that was debatable or something like that, just that it made me sleep. The sequel was no better in working as a sleeping pill.
A must watch movie for all about the inner workings of a mafia family. Brilliant performance by Marlon Brando.

Also, heard about the trickery with the Dark Knight from a German and this movie deserves justice.
I've never seen a movie that can move me the way the Godfather could. Crime movies try so hard to attain what the godfather did but fail miserably. Unfortunately in the day and age of remakes and sequels I don't see any movie ever topping this again.
I cant imagine this masterpiece made in 1972 its sooo good from the actors to the soundtrack to the twists to the mafia feel to the ending every thing was made by genius even it was old movie if you watched it you will fell its like in 2010 it was ahead of its time
It's one of those movies that I watch over and over again over the years. It is a masterpiece that even the new generation prefers to watch. Marlon Brando Al Pacino James Caan Performances are amazing.

This movie is questionably the best ever made. It's in my top five (at #4). #4 my seem a little high, but Scorsese slid into #1, #2, and #3.

Anyway, this movie was fantastic. Francis Ford Coppala has made the most memorable movie in movie history. That's a croc that Pacino didn't get best supporting actor, or Coppala getting best director. Oh well.

There's not a whole lot else to say, great plot, great acting, great character development, great movie! 10/10
I really don't understand people sometimes. Here we have the #1 rated movie on the list. An extremely famous film. A well made film in it's own right. But the story. It's AWFUL.

This is a story about a man how starts off as a fine upstanding citizen, a soldier, no less, and his gradual change into what I can only describe as a Total S**t.

I really did NOT like this movie. I did like it up to a point...once I realized that Michael was not going to overcome his demons.

I really don't feel I should waste any more time on this film, so I won't.
Let me start with what I didn't like about it. I know this is a personal preference, but I think the main storyline was too basic for me i.e. X does something to Y. Then Y gets X back. The X's friend gets Y back. And basically repeat that formula. The only thing that really changed was the methods of the attacks. And for this reason, I don't feel the need to watch part 2 / 3. But if you like this genre, then I can see why you would enjoy this movie.

Pros:

+ Great depiction of organised crime during that era. + The ability to build tension was top tier. If I was rating it solely on this, it's probably the most on the edge of my seat that I've been during a movie. + Loved all the characters & character development was great. + Fab acting.
This is a visual epic with grand performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando's "Banana Mouth Trick" is one of the most imitated characters in movie history.

Also, its stars Robert DuVall, James Caan and Al Pacino in oscar winning roles. Francis Ford Coppola directs, with relative Sofia putting in an uncredited performance.

The acting is solid, the story is brilliant, and the direction is superb.

Although this is true, I actually preferred the second sequel. This is probably because of Andy Garcia's incredible performance as Vinnie Corleone.

The Godfather Trilogy is Hollywood's greatest films. Do not miss any of them. They are true gems. Rating=4/5
It is very difficult to talk about this film as a film. It is the beginning of in institution of gangSTAR films. Scarface has it going on but this is beautiful artisty combining actors that were Oscar winners and actors who went on to win Oscars! Al Pachino was incredible in depiction of a dark Amrerican come Sicillian... Marlon Brando was inspiring and I think made it very hard for Bob DeNero to measure up to. James Caan was very good and even the support characters were so well written and acted out it was brilliant! Along with this the music was also very good with the mix of Italian and American Swing. I loved it!
This movie is a great piece of work no doubt about that. The acting is natural, the direction is good and cinematography even better. When they say that every frame is a painting...they mean it. And the brilliantly exicuted deaths of whoever dies in this movie. But The problem is that it didn't match the hype for me. It was suggested to Me by my friend and he said that this was the best movie he had ever saw. As he had seen a lot of movies I decided to watch this movie. This movie is boring in some parts and not completely interesting throughout. I finished this movie in 5 sittings. The scenes are unnecessarily dragged for no reason at all. And I tried hard to really root for the characters which didn't happen in my case. The bgm is great.....but to use the same bgm again and again got me irritated.

Overall great movie but highly overrated and boring


Its the best film I have ever watched and I recommend it to everyone who wants to learn about respect, honour and everything else in between, also you could learn a lot about Italians!




Why haven't I seen one of the most popular movies of all time? Well I finally did and it didn't disappoint. Despite the length of the movie, I was thoroughly engaged throughout. When a movie has you routing for the bad guys, it demonstrates the impact of an excellent story well executed. The film is so much more than just a gangster movie. It addresses politics, family values, crime and the social norms of the time. I know that I will watch this many more times as well as the Godfather films which follow. Fast paced, excellent acting, great music all combine to make this a must see.
It is no wonder The Godafather is often regarded as the best film ever. It was totally original at it's time and today, it is filled with great performances that set up wonderful careers, and it is overflowing with drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, action, and tragedy. This epic follows the Corleone family's trials and tribulations in New York and Italy. Vito is the don, Michael, Fredo, and Sonny are his three sons and Tom is his consigliere. This is my favorite of the GF movies. My favorite character is Sonny played by James Caan. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the late John Cazale are all excellent. In my opinion Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever, but this pulls in an ultra close second. 9/10
I really love this movie, and it is my favorite out of all three. They are unable to fully describe in words, they are masterpieces. This and the other two movies inspired me and moved me emotionally. I was crying at the end of the third movie! I felt as though I knew the characters personally, and felt anger and grief and sorrow and happiness throughout the rise and near fall of the Corleone Family. This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made, and you haven't lived yet if you love movies and haven't seen these films.

Totally superb from acting to directing to plot to dialogue. Definitely in my top 10 list and a joy to watch over and over again. To be fair there are a few negatives. At times it is difficult to understand what Marlon Brando is saying. Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel. The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon. In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly. You could say he was the Michael Jordan of hitmen.

The character of Lucy was just seen as a tramp used by Santino in the movie where she was a fairly interesting character as well as Johnny Fontaine. Anyone who has seen the movie should also read the book to understand what I mean.
This is by far the best Crime Drama ever made. It is much better than Goodfellas, which is good but it is a bit overrated. Marlon Brando is excellent in this movie. Although, sometimes I think of him as more of a supporting role than a leading role. He was still excellent. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all excellent in their supporting roles. I think Al Pacino was the best of all of them. Everyone else was great too. Diane Keaton was the only one who i did not care for. She just didn't really fit in.

The acting is definitely a plus in the Godfather and so is its Directing. It also has one of the best scripts ever written. No flat Dialogue or any corny lines. This is and will remain the best Crime Drama ever made. Thats a promise.
I don't see what anybody saw in this movie, boring, and redundant. I was bored with the film, and it is a horrible attempt to make a good movie. If you have any taste what so ever you will turn down a crapfest like this and watch something respectful like Batman, or The Rookie, or heck even Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. In any event stay away from this waste of film. 0 out of 10.

I had heard a lot about this epic masterpiece for so many years and so I tried to get a DVD copy or catch a T.V premiere or any possible way.Finally,the wait was over.And to my surprise it was worth the wait

The movie is not your usual type of movie.Its got brains,guts and glory all over it.The performances are extraordinary from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.You will have a great time watching this movie as every aspect of the movie is just perfect right from the acting department to the cinematography department.

I am very happy to have lived to this day to have watched the best cinematic experience ever.......THE GODFATHER.
A francis ford copolla classic that takes me to different worlds every time I watch it, and deserves 10 points from me with its shooting techniques and fascinating atmosphere. I wish I was in my twenties when this film was shot and I could watch this movie in the cinema.
This is a film--it's too dignified to call it a movie--that shatters things we usually take for granted about the genre. Movies are never as good as the books on which they're based--but this one is. Films about Italians always wallow in stereotypes--but this one doesn't. All-star epics always disappoint--but this one doesn't.

Pacino is truly amazing to watch as he gets drawn into the family business, and Brando's best scene is, oddly enough, his final one, where he's playing with his grandson. This is a man who's ordered countless deaths, beatings, etc., but to a small child, he's just Grampa, and he's the most wonderful grownup in the whole wide world.

If you've never seen this movie, you're doing yourself an injustice. Get it, see it, experience it.
So I have finally seen one of the most iconic films of all time. How does it feel? Like I accomplished something. One has to be keen on not having huge expectations when one watches films of this grand respect and stature in history. How was it?

The film does start slow, and from the first appreance of Brando to be honest I couldn't understand him much. However, over time goes by I was more and more interested in him. I was shocked when several scenes played out, and I am surprised that this isn't Brando's film. This is Pacino's film. Pacino is completely mesmerizing in his approach and character, and he is the one who has a transformation. He is somewhat of a bigger lead character than Brando. The entire cast is outstanding, and you really get to appreciate the script when you can really see the film with subtitles and realize how great the dialogue is.

Ready for Part 2!
I think what made this movie so great was the actors. The directing was also very superb. As i watched this movie, 30 plus years or so after it was made, i totally was engulfed in what was going on in the movie. Most great movies that i see that are older seem to be dull and boring, not this one. Yes it is long, and i had to take frequent breaks, it was far from boring. This is one of those movies that after i saw it i started acting like i was in a mob family. I started saying "I'm going to make him an offer he cant refuse." This movie is a great movie that mixes all kinds of genres, from romance to action, but it is mostly a full out drama. This movie is defiantly deserving of the top honor for best movie. I recommend it to all people, and even if you cant appreciate the plot, you have to appreciate the acting. By far the best acting in any film i have ever seen.

Seen this film over 100 times. Everything about it is great. Saw it when it was first released and it's never faded or got weaker.
Anyone speak Italian who can translate the restaurant scene between Solozzo and Mike. I understand that they didn't use the subtitle in order to add to the scene's tension; but for my curiosity, I want to know what was said. Can anybody help a sista out? lol (I'm somewhat new to IMDb as far as comments go, and it's telling me that I have to have a minimum of 10 lines but I don't have anything else to say or ask so I'm just gonna keep writing this pointless stuff here. Why do I have to have a minimum of ten lines. I'm only at eight right now so I guess I have to keep writing. Yeah, now I'm at nine, one more to go. And I'm done. thanx! :-)
There is greatness in "The Godfather". There is no denying that. I've seen it a bunch of times. There are too many great moments to mention but there are a few dull moments too. Maybe it's because it's always on tv. Maybe it's because I've hear quotes from this movie for the past 49 years. Maybe I've read too much about the making of this film. I don't know. It's still a really good movie. Don't get me wrong. It's just that I don't think the total package is as great as I used to think.
I must have watch this a 1,000 time amazing story and acting
Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.
Pretty good, but a bore at times. The plot was very good and has some turns, but overall the story unfolded very slowly. Only the actors did a great job to save the day. I was also very impressed by the music, when you closed your eyes, the music alone can put you in the story.
After hearing about this legendary film I decided it was about time I watched it....after about an hour I really wished I hadn't wasted the money renting it...after the movie finished I was bored. The film was nothing like I had expected and I don't know how it possibly made it as big as it has. It was quite well cast I love Diane Keaton but she's better in Woody Allen's comedy's than in this derivitive movie. You want a good gangster movie...watch Goodfella's...it actually has a good story, entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era. I'm not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz Marlon Brando ain't even in them so their ain't much point! I think I'll go watch Marlon Brando's greatest performance...Guy's N Doll's.
This is a movie about New York mafia family, The Corleones.Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is a movie that every movie lover should see.It has some classic dialog and many legendary scenes.The characters are brilliant, kind of people you care about even though they're gangsters.And the actors, they're really unforgettable.There are Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Abe Vigoda,the very young future Oscar winner Sofia Coppola and then of course Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone.Unfortunately we lost this incredible actor July 1st.That was last week.We sure will miss him.He was one of the greatest actors in the world.
I wasn't too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them.

The violence is brutal, the script is superb, and the soundtrack is incredible. Everyone involved should be proud at what they accomplished. I never read the book but fans say it's a faithful adaptation. Goodfellas is a mobster film I like slightly more but The Godfather is still a cinematic achievement. I know some people are going to get on my case for not calling it the best movie ever made in the history of mankind, but I'm not denying that it's a good movie.

Just watch it more than once to enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it like I did!
There is no doubt in my mind concerning the fact that The Godfather is the best movie of all time. From the flawless directing to the powerful acting, this movie is a must for every home video collection. Even today this movie still has the elements of surprise and shock which the majority of older movies no longer hold. Who could ever forget the memorable horse head scene. How the AFI ranked this movie number three still baffles me to this day. Coppola put his best forward and left all others behind.
This movie is hands down the best movie ever produced. The story that you see and the story that you don't see are both exciting and powerful. While action packed and emotional this movie will never fail to entertain me even I'd I watch it on repeat for a year I will always love it.


I've watched this trilogy over 100 times now I'm sure - I even have it on my laptop to use as reference when I need some life advice. I've enjoyed this masterpiece as a screenwriter and director and I've borrowed some wisdoms from both Vito and Michael to use when dealing with people. I would give it more than 10 in a rating if I had to. Always going to be the greatest franchises ever created!
I recently watched this film on Christmas Eve to pass some time before the big day and i can say i wasn't disappointing this film received 9.2 on this website which in my opinion is a bit overrated however it is still a hell of a movie the main plot behind this masterpiece is that "The Godfather" (Brando) is getting old and wants to pass on the family business to his son (Pacino)however Pacino is not to keen on it at first grows to understand what he must do. This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan & Talia Shire.

I highly recommend this movie so far i has seen this and The Godfather part 2 and they are both good films but i am yet to watch the 3rd one.

****/*****

The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This will be a movie that will live on through history.


This is barely a masterpiece in my opinion. The direction and acting are completely flawless but it lack a lot in writing compared to what people say. Its pretty enjoyable tho ngl.


To my opinion, the most overrated film of all times.

An overrated story of an overrated person (America's infamous home grown terrorist), played by an overrated actor - Marlon Brando, which has almost nothing left from the juicy stud that made your lips wet in "A streetcar called desire".

Rather than being a fine adaption of an anyway colorful book, and a playground for an impressive group of talents, the movie has not much else to offer. No one of the actors is at his/her best.

Technically, Coppola is a genious. The best 2 dimension director. But his films always lack the 3'rd dimension. You're coming out great, Frank, but what exactly are you trying to say?
Everyone in this movie has outstanding acting, especially Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, And John Cazale. Every time I watch this piece of art I forget that it's a movie due to the fact that the acting is so incredible.

One of the greatest sagas of all time!! I've watched every single minute. The depth that writer takes is not easily written and the actors brings it to life with absolute brilliance.

Almost 50 years old this film is still one of the greatest ever. The depth, feeling and acting is top of the charts. For a movie 50 years old, the action scenes and violent parts keep up impressivly well. It is the ultimate film for using the cliché: You dont watch this movie, you experience it.
This isn't the first time I have seen this film, but circumstances have given me a chance to see it in a new light.

I bought a Blu Ray player, and this film was recommended as the film to see in the new format. I was not disappointed. The richness of the color made the film an extreme pleasure.

I also watched it with captions to not miss a word of the dialog.

There is nothing new that can be said about this film. It is a classic, and the actors are all superb, as is the story itself. It is rare that a film like this comes around, and watching it in Blue Ray just made it all extra special.
Color Grading is spectacular.

Liked the way the story is told!

Good Narrative and not boring at all!

It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.
All my life I heard of this series known as the Godfather series. Do I really want to invest all this time? I heard each movie is three hours long. Do I really want to watch a bunch of shoot'em ups? About five years ago I broke down and watched the first one in the saga. I was completely dumbfounded and amazed with this masterpiece. Very few movies fall under the word masterpiece and this is definitely one of them. I gave this a 10.
I saw this movie and i fell in love with it. It is the strongest movie i have ever seen .This movie gave a clear and transparent view of "The Mafia Family".This movie defines what cinema is(are).Four Thumbs Up!!!! for "The Godfather" and i hope everybody who watches this movies falls in love with it. Marlon Brando,i got no words for his appreciation what shall i tell him "The Real Godfather of Actors" yes that would be very less to call him so he is above that also. He was born to do Don Vitto Corleone and Don Vitto Corleone was written for him only.Al Pacino,ah what a strong Performance speechless,boundless loved him as Michael Corleone The real Son of The Godfather just can say this.and James Caan,Robert Duvall and Diana Keaton are also the important part without them "The Godfather" would be incomplete.just wanna say watch it




Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting.
An overlong and slow film that may have seemed better 50 years ago, but is now boring and very dated. Marlon Brando's make up looks so fake and the obviously Jewish James Caan is badly miscast as an Italian-American. The restaurant meeting would never have happened in reality - Sollozzo tries to kill Vito, and then just a few days later Michael is just going to sit down and have dinner with him? Lol. In any case Sollozzo would have known the police captain had to remain on call 24 hours a day. McClusky would have given a false location, rather than the restaurant, to the police.
This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen that's all that I'm gonna say.
Yes this is a great film, but not flawless. The casting is great, nice plot, some excellent scenes. However the pace is really too slow. I understand that some films need to be long, films with lots going on. But this is 2 hours entertainment, not 3. If this film had been shorter then it may possibly have been the greatest ever.
What a boring movie.

How can such a movie be rated that high? Will always be a secret to me.
This is many peoples favourite film of all time. Vito Corleone is the Godfather and is the head of a powerful mafia family. Although heavily involved in organised crime the Corleone empire is very much underpinned by trust and honour.

The real story of the Godfather is how Michael changes from being an ordinary citizen with no desire to be involved in the gangster lifestyle to eventually become the head of the family. The catalyst for this is the attempted assassination of Vito during a mafia war caused by Vito's unwillingness to become involved in drugs.

The acting is quite superb and you shouldn't forget that Al Pacino was a relative unknown when this was released. Marlon Brando won the best actor award for Vito. The screenplay is superb and like all the best films you become extremely involved with several of the characters. A true classic.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
The Godfather is not a bad movie. But no way in hell is it one of the Greatest movies of all time. It's not great at all. It's a decent movie, but it is absolutely overrated. It didn't even set any precedents or break new ground or anything. It's just a 3-hour long gangster movie with not interesting stuff happening. OVERRATED!!!!!!!
If you enjoy action paced movies with great character depth and story telling opt for goodfellas. If you like slow paced, drama like story telling opt for the Godfather. It's wasn't my cup of tea but you can see why people might put it into being considered a classic. The movie for the time when released was ahead of its time. Nowadays it would go straight to dvd.
Probably I have seen this film 3-4 times and always enjoyed it. The merit of the film is obviously its plot, but the director Coppola did an excellent work to unite several good actors/actresses in this production. Al Pacino was starting at that time, and he did superb work as Michael, James Caan showed his abilities as Sony, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando were excellent as usual, while Diane Keaton and Talia Shire did what was required from them. The film goes from New York to Sicily then back to New York, it certainly made the small village of Corleone very famous, many tourists coming from America may ignore the existence of Greek ruins in several parts of the island, particularly in the town Agrigento, but they do know that Corleone is there. Another admirable aspect of the film is that those actors representing Italians of Italo-Americans talk either in English, in Italian and even in Sicilian dialect. It is not my intention to describe the plot of the film here, but it shows that each of the families has an affective feeling to its relatives but is cruel at the time of punishment, no matter if it is a relative or not.



When watching this film, you really can see and appreciate how many films that has come after take inspiration from this all-time classic. Francis' direction is masterful in every way, Marlon Brando's method acting in this film is immaculate, to me, Brando is Vito Corleone, "The Don", "The Godfather"
The Godfather is crap...it's a long movie about nothing. I would rather die than watch that crap again...notice crap is written more than a few times? That's because, this is what this movie is...CRAP! The acting is bad, the sets are bad. Overall this is junk. How in the world it's number one on the top 250 is beyond me. You people must have nothing better to do than to watch a movie where people get killed off because they opened their mouths or voiced their thoughts. I can watch that on the news. I hate this movie so much that my roommates are watching it right now, and I have my CD player on as loud as it will go, because I hate this movie! So in closing...The Godfather, all of them, are crap!
Coppola's masterpiece is the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. The actors are amazing, the roles are fit perfect to the actors, the plot is fantastic, and the music.... that music is perfect, it is terrifying, and give you goosebumps, and fit absolutely to the depressing moments of the The Godfather. I recommend this movie to everyone who can appreciate the pleasure of the movie arts.
The Godfather is by far one of the greatest films of all time. Since I haven't been on IMDb for over 3 months I got to see quite a lot of great films over the summer. The Godfather has to be the best movie I saw over the summer. Marlon Brando, to my eyes delivered the best character in a movie ever. Wow, such a great film. I started growing into Mafia movies more and now I'm obsessed with it. This is my 5th favorite movie of all time. The screenplay, acting, cinematography, dialouge, and directing were superb!! You have to see this amazing film!! Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and everyone else did marvelous. Thank god they made this movie.

10/10
In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story.

If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. With 175 minutes running time the movie is quite long, but I promise it is worth it.
If anybody can point out any flaws in The Godfather, I'd like to see them do it. Watching this movie makes me want to join the mob. If somebody ever names me Godfather to their child, I'll be too tempted to give them a horse's head. Vito Andolini Corleone, his sons MIcheal, Santino,and Fredo, his friends Sal and Peter. What a collection of hooligans. This isn't a great movie.It's a perfect movie.

This movie isnt that good but it's definitely not bad. Everyone talks about this movie like it's some masterpiece but quite frankly it's boring in some scenes, got to so bored the first time watching that I stopped watching a few times that day.
this is a masterpiece this is incredible and amazing watch this movie you won't regret it this is cool i love it people call it amazing and wonderful and outstanding it is cool and it has moments that other movies probably don't have enjoy this movie it is incredible and it has incredible action scenes and incredible special effects and directing
'The Godfather' left me in many emotions. Lucky to witnessed such cinema? Yes, but my summary says my current expression. Does Power Always Get It Right ?

'The Godfather', known to be one of the greatest films ever made, is a stab on it's viewer. Francis Ford Coppola has directed it with his instincts, he knows that Mr.Vito Corleone & Family do not exist in real-life. What embodies in an otherwise great film, are it's performances. Late Marlon Brando is stunning as The Godfather. 'THE' actor inside him buries his past and beings a fresh journey here. James Caan as Sonny, is another astonishing performance.

'The Godfather' not only personifies power, but also it's MAJOR disadvantages. Let me end this review, this way: If a 1000 plus word review justifies this masterful depresso, I better inform you, that, even a half-page review is a near-perfect respect.
This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier.

With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business.

The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the movie is the definition of a great epic. I feel that this movie has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.

Do not miss this movie!
First saw this film back in Sydney in the early seventies. Had a certain kudos then as it was a groundbreaking film of its sort. Or so the story goes! Watched it on BBC i player as there was nothing else at all in the film catalogue. Main observations after all these decades. In the signature and most memorable moment in the whole 3 hours plus (snooze), I would love to know how the mafia goon managed to get the enormous horses head in the bed without the director in it waking up. Apologies if IMDb have already noted this ludicrous goof in the list of goofs. It was a completely lame scene if you will forgive the pun Marlon Brando seems to be having trouble with vocal clarity and was slurring his way throughout the film. Maybe hitting the Sicilian wine a little hard? All in all, including the mammoth length of the movie, no satisfactory end. Of course it was groundbreaking possibly for this reason and this reason alone. They were laying the foundation for a franchise of Godfathers. Something the film industry in the twentieth first century have taken to the max.
"The Godfather" is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film! Great director, cinematographer and composer! In addition, it is deeply Sorcerer movie makes you think and analyze life, the finer points of human relations, reveals the true values of life. Great game actors, watching where you wake up in empathy. This is my favorite movie.
Yes, it is perfect. Every praise you hear about it is true. When every aspect of making a film is top-notch, you get the absolute movie. I would like to note though, Godfather is NOT a movie to watch while eating your pizza. It needs you to be completely devoted to it.
This is one of my favorite movie. The videography was amazing. Styling and costumes were on point. Overall beautiful.
This is honestly the most one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. No way in hell does it get so many good ratings based on anything more than sheer nostalgia.

I don't know how good it was 50 years ago, but it does not stand the test of time.
Just an amazing movie with an awesome script! One of the best stories ever told. The way this story is told is something that I couldn't expect, with so much drama but also the reality of that world. We feel so connected with the family, with the characters. The photography increase the drama of the movie. Like the last take, we want so much to see how his going to be with all that power. Absolutely worth watching this movie, especially. You are learning from the very best. It's also the kind of a movie that every time that I watch I can see something different. Very honest with the book. Almost three hours that we can't feel. I wish there were more movies like this these days.
My most favorite movie ever. watch many times. shear with many friends. actors did great job in this movie.
One of the best movies ever made about the mafia until today! I'm still waiting that arises a work like this movie. Violent and realistic, is a perfect picture of how the mafia could be good and cruel at the same time. Full of meaning, deaths and colorful characters, is absolutely impossible to peel off eyes of the screen for a second even. Is an epic about a descent into hell and desperate attempts to see the light again. And the rise of credits, the viewer realizes that he was facing one of the most powerful stories of love and hatred of the cinema.

The Godfather is without a doubt one of my 5 favorite movies, one of the most important films in history, the most commented, imitated and revered in cinema. And is the question: is the best movie ever? When we stop to think about days after seeing the movie we were in doubt, but to watch no doubt of the answer. Almost like an offer we can't refuse. Note: 10

Everybody said that this film was the best ever done so I have wanted to see this for years(and the other parts I shall soon see).So when I found out that it would come on DVD I planned to buy it,and so I did. And when I saw it I thought it was an masterpiece.Perfect in every ways. The whole cast acts excellent and Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for best leading role.It´s also a very beautiful epic and the music is fantastic.I almost forgot to write that the direction by Francis Ford Coppola is also excellent.Still it has done better films than "the Godfather" but it´s really a Masterpiece.If you don´t own the Godfather collection on DVD run out and buy it now.5/5
I liked it a lot. It's truly a masterpiece. I thought he cast was well priced and he director did a phenomenal job at directing this film. I also think the sequel is as good as the first, if not better. If I could give this film more than 10 stars right now, I honestly would. I remember going with my boyfriend to see it, for it is his favorite film. He laughed and cried and wanted to see it again and again. I am the same exact way. I not only likes this movie, but I loved it, and I still do. Even now when I see a grandfather clock I always think of this movie. Actually, writing this review right now is giving me so many amazing and beautiful memories of the movie that I want to go and see it again. I would truly recommend see this movie as soon as possible. I'm sure you wouldn't regret it. It made me the person I am today.


The Godfather is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made. It combines a superb plot, excellent acting, and top-drawer directing. Brando is great. Pacino is at his best. Add Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire in spectacular performances and you have a terrific ensemble cast. The plot, which combines a mob story with the moving story of a family -their lives, loves, and loyalties- is brilliantly written. It can definitely be called the greatest film ever made.
I have seen The Godfather about 30 times and each and every time I see it, it still manages to impress me. It's not like any other "mob" movie that's out there. It's about loyalty, honor, and family which were the most important aspects of the early-day Mafia. It exemplifies every aspect of the commitment to keep a family together no matter what. The saga of the Corleone family, from "Don" Corleone and then to Michael Corleone, is absolutely brilliant. There isn't one defining moment; the movie as a whole is a tremendous masterpiece. I don't believe there will be another movie that will come close to capturing the depth and beauty of this film; at least not in this lifetime.
I think that Godfather made deep dents in the film industry. I can confidently say that this movie, with such enthralling and compassionate acting and directing, deserves even more praise that it is already receiving. I have watched this movie more than thirty times and each time is even more enriching. Absolutely no blemish. However, let me remind you that THIS IS NOT A CRIME MOVIE, but of mostly of family principles and character which is so lacking in so many other movies.
I eventually saw this film as it is widely regarded as one of the best ever made. The hype and the 10/10 ratings ARE true. This is excellent! I saw Godfather 2 first as it deals with the young Vito in part so comes (chronologically) first in the series but part 1 is the best. From Marlon Brandos oscar-winning performance to Al Pacino (the true star) this film is practically perfect. Vitos demise, Michaels rise, the downfall and eventual success of the Corleone family - all perfectly plotted. Any film that can make you care for gangsters has to be doing something right. There are some dubious moral issues, but this is a movie - you watch it to be entertained. Who can forget the horses head scene, Sonnys assassination, even the oft-repeated quotes such as `I`m gonna make him an offer he can`t refuse`... If you haven`t seen this film then watch it. I only wish I had seen this film earlier.
Long before serial killers, heroes, comedies, and dramas you had this masterpiece The, Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola knew just how to organize this so well by showing how a family made a living and going to elite power in the process. Marlon Brando is the greatest as Don Vito head of the family, then open the door for son Michael Corleone played perfect by Al Pacino. The, Godfather helped make Pacino a household name. The, Godfather also uses one of the best film editing techniques possible the work of Russian film editor Pudovkin as his editing technique of linkage of shots adds to the drama of The, Godfather. The scene of the baptism is linked just at the very same moment with the murder scene of enemies sure it is not the best pace but the scene is just perfect, and the drama of the events is increased through editing by linkage of shots by comparing death to a baptism both highly valued rituals in the mob. The, Godfather is the best from everything with the filming, acting, and the story. As you know The, Godfather will be the greatest classic forever.
The Godfather is the greatest Drama movie ever. This movie has the best plot, acting, and script of all movies ever made. I would recommend it to everyone. Also, Part II is good too.

10 out of 10

***** out of *****

If you liked this movie, I would recommend "Scarface"
This movie is incredible. It's the perfect story of family combined with the mafia. This is an amazing story of how power can corrupt and change people, and perfectly blends a balance of family into the mafia life. This movie truly shows the passage of time from the old ways of Vito corleone to the present day ways that do not suit him, and overall help mold the story and craft a beautiful and incredible movie that is one that everyone should see.
Visuals, story, acting, directing, musics... this is basically the maximum directors can reach. shawshank redemption is a great movie but it's lacking in many such as visuals. If I meet an alien and they ask me what's the best movie you guys ever made, I would give them this and say second one is almost as good as the first one.
I will never, ever understand the love affiar people have with this movie. It is completely and utterly over-rated. Marlon Brando is not the god of an actor he and people make him out to be. Neither is Al Pachino for that matter. The acting is pretty stiff and unbelieveable. It was so freaking LONG. Ugh, I hate this movie.
Good solid movie, but far from the greatest movie or even greatest gangster movie of all time.

Doesn't come close to Good Fellas or Casino.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in film making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. If i can give it 11 stars out of 10, i will.
this movie was more boring than church! they just talked and talked they hardly ever shot anybody! Michael Corleone is a little girly man! and that Sonny guy, no one intimidating is named Sonny! when he got blown to bits, i laughed....hard! Then there's Vito! What's with this guy? Does he have marshmallows stuffed in his mouth? why does he look like that? and what's with that name...Vito? who names thier son after a presidential command! it could only be one typed of people, hillbillies. Italian Mafia hillbillies. If you want a real good movie go see Santa With Muscles! he'll stop them Corleones!

It was like your building a high tower, and with the rules of construction to do something like that you must start with a solid tough base can hold the weight and levels. Godfather was written first with a unique way, that made you more interested to see the man's life, who can change you life, or even make your life in past with a word. For me it started with the DOP, with the amazing picture. Decoration, accessories, the site, and really the performance of all these stars together. Music was amazing and much matching the time of the movie, specially when you do your search of the music of that time. Last and least, the Director, who controlled all of his tools and made this great movie, i never felt bored of watching it.
Great Acting dreadful editing. It's one of those must see movies but its just over rated. Watch the horse's head scene and see how badly edited it is...terrible seeing as everyone holds it in such high regard. Wobbly sound and out of focus cuts throughout. Coppola should be ashamed.
There isn't much that I can say about The Godfather that hasn't been said a million times. A masterpiece, as close to a perfect film as you can get, arguably the best film ever made, "a film you can't refuse," etc. Coming from a guy who's favorite films have mafia/gangster-related themes, The Godfather is the greatest film ever made in the history of U.S. cinema, in my slightly biased opinion.

From the legendary music (beautiful work by Nino Rota), to the cast and the acting (Brando, Pacino, and Caan), to the cinematography (brilliantly done by Gordon Willis, aka "The Prince of Darkness"), to the fascinating story and everything in between, there is nothing about this film that disappoints. It is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once in his or her lifetime, because the chances are that you will want to watch it again.
Just didn't like it that much. Maybe I'll like it more when I'm older


I grew up with films like this where the directors tried to show even though it's a man in crime that compromises can be made. Today's movies are terrifying.
A masterpiece everyone should watch. One of the best film ever made and surely my top film of my personal 100 most loved films. It shows the reality around us, the presence of evil and the presence of good inside evil. Everyone has good inside himself, even the most ruthless criminal.
I watched this movie three times in an attempt to see why such a poorly written, directed, and acted movie is so revered by fans and critics alike. Aside from the music (which is the only good thing about this movie really), I found everything about this movie to be mediocre at best. I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed. And the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid. The only logical explanation for this movie's acclaim is that this movie is a mafia propaganda movie to instill fear and respect towards them. And the mafia forced critics to praise this title by placing severed horse heads in their beds!
I do not understand the big fuss about the Godfather trilogy OK yes the acting is top quality with brilliant performances from marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and even talia Shire is good but the film just drags the whole story is boring and the films just seem to go over the same things over and over again.

I must admit that i am probably not the best person to review the godfather seeing as i don't really like gangster movies i didn't like Goodfellas either although i did like like the untouchables I believe people saying they love the godfather movies is simply because they have heard other people saying how good it is and think that in order to be considered a proper movie lover they have to like the godfathers.
Watched it and I must say it had a very different story and marvelous dialogues that can create an impact.
Godfather having score 9,1 and being 2nd best movie in IMDB? Yeah, good acting and plot twist, but it's just 6,0 movie. I don't think it's even a good movie.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definite film.
Possibly one of the most overhyped movies I've ever watched, don't get me wrong that doesn't mean it's bad, I just think the reputation it holds is too big, I'm sure for when it came out it would be considered a masterpiece but now in 2021 I wouldn't say so

I thought the performances were really good from most of the actors especially Brando. The story was fairly straight forward and there was little action, and the dialogue through the movie was quite bland

The movie had some stand out scenes which I won't spoil but honestly, if I had never watched this movie I wouldn't feel like I was missing out, 6/10.
As I was about to watch the movie for the first time, almost 50 years after it's realese, I was expecting it to feel old and outdated. I was wrong. I mean, yes, some parts like image quality and visual effects could have been done better today but they're still not bad. Once the movie got started it found a really good pacing. And the fact that the movie felt so real just made it more tense and engaging. Now, I'm no expert in cinematography, but I felt like I was understanding what was happening in each scene and not once was I interupted by an unatrual tempo or poor cuts. I can definitly see why this is considered a classic and why people love it so much. The question is if the movie really deserves the second highest rating on IMDB?

This movie was not #1 of the top 250 worthy. It was not the greatest film of all time. Even though, I did enjoy watching this, I would only give the a 6.2/10. If you are dying to see this, don't. It's not that great, even though it's not the worst film ever.
Living up to the edge of this film is what each mob film stands for. This is the film that started the mob genre in my opinion. A classic story in its own mind, and a perfect hit to cinema. Based off the saga by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola's first chapter of the epic legacy that lives on as The Godfather. The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino. Terrificly follows the novel, with solid editing and setting, and outstanding performances by everybody. Fits elements that put you into the shoes of a true mobster, dealing with real mandatory things in a crime family, jobs, deaths, and deals. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone is a magnificent performance that really gets into the character of a true mob leader, making offers people can't refuse. Coppola's best work ever, and one of the greatest films ever made!
The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.
The few "perfect" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern "cinema", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather.
It was the first event movie of the 70s, the one multitudes queued up to see, the one whose dialogue, characters and imagery instantly became ingrained in the collective consciousness. It made stars of Pacino and Caan, won Oscars for Picture, Screenplay and Brando, in a triumphant comeback. Shortly after its premiere in 1972 Variety reported, "The Godfather is an historic smash of unprecedented proportions". At the time the director, Francis Ford Coppola, was holed up in a hotel writing the screenplay for The Great Gatsby, a job he took to relieve his financial problems because he believed in his movie. He had only been given the film after a lengthy wish-list of veterans including Otto Preminger, Elia Kazan, Fred Zinnemann and Franklin Schaffner turned it down. He perked up when Frank Capra wrote to him, claiming it was, " Out of this world. I cheered inwardly at scene after scene."




I got a laugh from the people who found this film to be unoriginal, lukewarm, or not up to the standards of other mob films or tv shows. "The Godfather" is the grand daddy of them all! Coppola and Puzo practically invented the genre of "mafiosi as Shakespeare". Given how subsequent films and tv shows have run with these themes (even done them to death) most of what you're left with in this film is acting and craftsmanship. But man o man. It doesn't get better. "Shawshenk Redemption", in contrast, was a good installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame.
This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many "books"(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made.

I was actually married to someone in the same position when we went to see the Godfather and I'm afraid my review is marred by my experience. So much of the movie was ridiculous while some parts were accurate. I didn't enjoy watching this due to being involved in what was being glamorised on the big screen.. I found the mafia ISNT the highly regarded organisation it claims to be. I was told over and over they never hurt the innocent and there is a lot of honour in the mafia which I discovered is untrue. The backstabbing and lying even among family members is shocking and there is no honour.. absolutely none!


The best movie I've ever seen in my life and, of course, the best movie in the world, Marlon Brando is just excellent as The Godfather, the performances of the whole actors are beautiful. Even the extras acts good(including the cat lmao) I think this movie is the example of "how to do the best movie in the history". The best movie, just that.
One of the best movies based on the underworld. The story holds you until the end. The terrific performance of the actors are very much convincing. Overall, it's a must-watch for every movie lover.
Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of the best films in history, and definitely the most iconic. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as its lead characters, it is much more than just a mafia film. It delves deep into society and family. It explores the corruption of government, the power the mafia had at the time, and doesn't hold back to portray the brutal life of the Corleone family. It tells a tragic story of how the well-mannered Michael Corleone turns into a cold-blooded murderer and eventually a kingpin. Throughout its long runtime, it gives you no time to rest, throwing twist after twist, and by the time credits start rolling, you will be rooted to your seat, your jaw wide open. Its storytelling is flawless, its characters are multi-layered and you care about them, especially Vito and Michael, who are essentially bad individuals. This is more than a movie, it is an epic, a journey, an observation of how great men descent into the world of crime. If you have not seen this yet, do so right now. You will never be able to look at other films the same way ever again.
This isn't just a crafted gangster film also family portrait too. An inspirational movie to generation to generation of actors, directors, producers & screenwriters.
A cult that hosts the most beautiful and special scenes in the history of cinema. Perhaps the most impressive film in the history of cinema. It immerses you in the movie with its music and realistic scenes.
It's incredible how Coppola directed this film, every shot in this movie is well thought and incredibly executed. The script is basically perfect in every aspect. Cinematography is amazing as well, and the performances are impeccable. And off course the soundtrack is a character on his own. A true masterpiece.
I believe that there is little that need to be said about the "Godfather". A true masterpiece, whose characters has become legendary (who has not heard about Don Corleone), has been followed by an equally great sequel (not counting Godfather III which is a good movie but definitely belongs to a lower league than I and II), and has inspired and paved the road for other legendary mafia films ("Goodfellas", "Once Upon A Time in America").

With a large bunch of all-time classic actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, the performances given in Godfather provide the definition of top quality cinema. In short, "Godfather" is one of the films that everybody should watch at some point of his/her life. 10/10.
One of,if not,the best movie of all time,The Godfather has it all in terms of drama,violence,etc.The thing that is very special about this movie is that it sets the gangster film archetype in concrete and would inspire future gangster greats such as Scarface,Godfather:Part Two and Three,Goodfellas,Carlito's Way,The Departed,etc.This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola which was adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name.The cast of this movie includes Marlon Brando as the iconic Don Vito Corleone,at the time newcomer Al Pacino as Vito's youngest son,Michael,James Caan as hotheaded Santino"Sonny",Robert Duvall as Consigliere Tom Hagen,Diane Keaton as Michael's love interest,Kay Adams and John Cazale as Fredo Corleone.It would win the Academy Award for Best Picture,Best Actor-Brando and would additionally receive nominations for Best Supporting Actor-James Caan,Al Pacino and Robert Duvall.One of my favorite films and a crime classic.Bravo!Excellent!

One never knows when one will be bested. Did Citizen Kane anticipate Vito Corleone popping a couple of cotton buds in his cheeks and changing cinema forever? With the possible acceptation of Shawshank, the characters, cinematography, screenplay et al have not been surpassed and it is unlikely they ever will be. If you haven't seen it you're a missing out. It defines the term classic. It is timeless and everlastingly relevant. We'll still be watching this film in six hundred years. It's the Mona Lisa of Movies. The Beethoven of Film.
There is nothing more to say The sences are longer than avarage, I think thats the reason many people are finding it boring but the acting is outstanding, even with not including the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando, that is widely considered as the best performance of the best actor of all time. I have seen this movie hundreds of times and every time I love it more
Either someone stuffed the ballot box on this one or people are merely voting for an icon without really thinking about it. This movie does not even remotely deserve its reputation. There is no significant character development; it is too long (and that's an understatement); and in quite a few places, the plot drags interminably.
The best part of all parts.. I really loved it Marlon Brandon worth the oscar
Can't stop watching and playing this best action scene on my PS3.
Very nive story . The picture cinematography and acting are awesome
The most perfect film ever made. I watched it with my father when I was young (probably too young). I have since seen it at least 50 times. The direction, acting, costume and production is faultless. There are so many scenes that will be remembered forever. So many lines that people just know from memory. The music is also sublime. Pacino for me steals the show (and what a show). Maybe only because he has more memorable scenes. Duvall, Brando and Cazale run him very close. The three scenes I love more than ever are Michael's revenge in the restaurant (greatest scene of all time!), when Michael realises from the panic in his bodyguard's face as he runs off that Apollonia is in danger and when Sonny beats up Calo and finishes him in the gutter. Superb from start to finish.

Speechless What a Movie These movies are handmade with dedication
This is the best movie that i ever seen!!! awesome acting by Al Pacino and Marlon Berando great great and great!!!!!!!!!

Obviously this is the greatest production of world. Best direction Best actress Best music composition Best edit and best story for ever and ever
Right from the initial ever-so-slow zoom into a terrified sit down with Don Corleone, we are baptized into the family by means of respect and, more pointedly, fear. You are set up and then walking the fine line between victim and family throughout. Quoted ad infinitum, the story itself is quite involved and is only topped by the frenetic ending. Dark and hypocritical, this is a convoluted ride to places better left on the big screen (which we now all have at home).Brando, Pacino, Duval and James Caan all deliver most convincingly, while the other actors, or soldiers (if you will) carry out their orders dedicatedly. Frances Ford Coppola struck cinema gold with the Mario Puzo best seller!
One of the best movies I have ever see, and I love it everything about this movie. Nothing in this movie is too much, every scene in the movie is perfect. The movie is with best cast ever, best directing, good story. It is about crime, family and their relationship. The best thing about it is that movie don't have any flaw. The best way to describe it is with word MASTERPIECE. When movie is in parts I, II ... often only first part is good and others bad, but it is not case with this movie. It's 40 years old movie, and still one of the best, I thing that information tells a lot. Don't miss this movie, because most of you will watch it again and again. :D
Much like The Exorcist, this is a film that is praised my amateur minds, who know little about what makes a decent film. It has a few moments that brought a smile to my face, (well, one...when if finally finished). It's far, far too long, a self-indulgence that seeps into the rest of the movie. I found Brando's performance to be hammy, unconvincing and laughable, (how did a guy resembling a giant hamster control this group of poorly-acted gangsters?) Quite literally nothing of any significance occurs in this film, it's just an endless succession of mumbling, shooting, and glaring. I suppose that masochists find it entertaining, everybody else either A; Hasn't seen it, or B; Are lying. The "special effects" for the shooting scenes are very 1970's, ie, poor. It's no use saying this is a classic-to me, it 'aint, and i'm somebody who KNOWS he's right!! Watch something of true class instead...though you'll be hard pushed to find anything in the crime genre.
The film has a strong script and has turned it into a masterpiece. Of course, Alpacino's role has given a pleasant taste to this film and made an attractive mafia film that all types should experience the pleasure of watching it once.
First of all this Movie contains a message and that is 'If you have the power use it your way'. An in the movie the director followed it perfectly. His work should be applauded What a movie!!! This is basically a movie on gangsters! and this has everything in the life on a don 'The Godfather'. This movie obviously deserves 10! Acotrs acted brilliantly, Story was brilliant, direction was awesome, It's just perfect! 'The Godfather' has everything to call it 'The Godfather' it has emotions, action, real life, romance everything is perfect in it! I am not amazed with the fact that it's no.1 in the world it should be! And by the way a film which which is this real should be no.1! The film has answered everything about a don's questions! You can use this film's message into your life and that is: 'If you have the power use it your way'
This movie was just a movie. I have a definitely sure thing as this movie just doesn't deserve this score. I'm ok with sayings like "Omg how you say this, it's the godfather" so what? What makes the Godfather a Godfather. Couldn't have gotten this score just for acting and editing so ? It was very very nice but it was just a New York gangs story and it was like eh. What made you feel like giving this movie a 10. What? I'm begging you to make me feel like this. I watched this movie after seeing this score and it take my 3 hours. I'm happy for satisfying my curiosity but not for movie. The Shawshank Redemption or Seven or another movies were way better. I still don't know what was the point of the movie and why it have a score like 9,2. It is clearly 7,8-8,4 and just take it away from the list top 3. I don't want to watch 2 and 3 but o have to anymore. I'm sorry.
I am half Italian, so I must comment on this film. It is a part of my family, it is our heritage. Almost everyone in my family owns the trilogy. They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It's an offer you can't refuse.
The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.

The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.
The classic gangster movie that all others after it aspire to be like. Yes its long, but engaging throughout. A realistic view into the life of being in the mob family from all perspectives, the boss, the wives, the rest of the family, the cops, and the others on the outside. "Never hate your enemies" and "friendship is everything" are my favorites quotes. Inevitably in the mob world back stabbing and double-crossing happens, and outside of the mob world too.
It's kinda hard to describe this movie. After watching it, every other movie that I have seen just feels... I don't know... weak. Inferior. Fake.

The incredible performances in this film make it feel real. The story is awesome. It's tense when it needs to be tense, sad when it needs to be sad, and it makes you feel for the characters, who are written brilliantly.

I can't say anything more than that you need to see this movie. An epic masterpiece. 10/10.
I feel bad rating this because everyone seem to love this firm and i just .... bored. The movie is so slow and so long i cant believe i sit though. The acting is great but cant save the movie in my point. Idk maybe this is just not the movie for me


This Film is one of my favorite films of all times. I think that Coppola take a big risk after THX and Zootrope. This is a profound story about human nature trying to balance between the human desire of power the love of family. Every time I have the opportunity of see this film, I try to figure out how Francis resolve anything in the way to make a complete piece about the family issues, but in the same time a great portrait of the Italian mafia that today it's the ambiance and pace formula for the mafia films and also in Mexico the formula for the Mexican cartels. Also the great decision to invite a Al Pacino for the main role it's an excellent direction just below of the Brandon's performance.
Well I'm 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn't figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it's a good movie and worth watching.

7/10 definitely a classic, just don't expect and edge of your seat action flick.
It's impossible not to like this movie. It's 'oldie, but goldie'. Such a good movie. And Marlon Brandon is one of the greatest actors ever. FF Coppola made a marvellous job in turning into a great movie the Mario Puzo's book. If you are a movie watcher, you have to see this. It'll mark you for life.
Why is this so overrated? The wedding sequence is so dull ,it made me bored.Come on the editor has done an ugly job.This movie could well be in 130-150 minutes.An overrated movie that takes too much time.Believe me skip this one,it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.The movie stands to its hype.
I am a teenager, and i never thought of finding The Godfather so interesting! It shows a vivid and perfect example of the words Classic and Timeless in a movie. The Godfather takes you to different heights with each scene, directed of course, by Francis Ford Coppola.

Marlon Brando plays one of his funniest (for me, anyway) and greatest role. Al Pacino is another worth mentioning, the acting and the presentation of both actors are some of the key success of the Godfather. Having seen the movie, makes me want to pick up the book! If you need a break from all the recent "typical movies", then watch The Godfather.

Francis Ford Coppola was 33 years old in 1972. That was the year of The Godfather. Coppola raised the bar---in relation to directing a movie. Things in movie land would never be the same. This was a great craftsman at work...and The Godfather became a land mark movie. Other films would be compared to the real thing, and very few got anywhere near this original Classic. Its now 40 years later, and were still waiting for a real challenger. Of course--its not going to happen. A movie like The Godfather could never be made today. We have directors who don't care to even try !! I understand that. It would require vision and a rich talent that skips several generations. It was Coppola who refused to back down when the studio brass wanted Ernest Borgnine for the lead role. He demanded Brando. He got Brando. Brando was great. This is one of those rare movies where all the planets align-----and everything works perfectly. Acting, screen play, music, etc.etc. Hell....even the best boy was the best, best boy in history !!


A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.
A GREAT MOVIE, one of the best film art ever, the actors are great especially Al Pacino that made there(in my opinion) his best performance of his career. this movie takes you inside the Italian mafia world in the US but more important, it takes you inside the Corleone family, it shows the the relationship between the father, Don Vito and his children, especially with Michael(Al Pacino). What makes this movie so fascinating is the way that Francis Ford Coppola(the director) make you to identify with the main characters - people who murder their enemies and live like they are above the law, he make you love and admire the bad guys - The Mafia. In conclusion, the godfather is one of the best movies I have ever seen and i recommend it to all the film lovers. for anothe reviews: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur44998795/?ref_=nb_usr_prof
Theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters.

Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making,
The ultimate classic of all classic movies. From the directing to the all star acting, supporting cast, and crew. This will forever be a classic and I mean the entire collection. Awesome!
Awesome directing, acting, and energy. This is a classic that will remain a classic forever. The entire collection is amazing and highly appreciated.
The Godfather is probably the most perfect movie ever made. A strong plot, a unique cast, direction, filming and editing are beyond words, and the music makes you blend in. There are other great movies of course, but some of them lack one or two things mentioned above. It's difficult to match this one. Francis Coppola probably did that with The Godfather Part II (1974), and he may have exceeded himself. The Godfather is such a masterpiece that you can watch it over and over again and you will never be bored but always surprised how wonderful it is. Just to see young Al Pacino change for a college boy to a ruthless mafioso is a miracle of movie-making, even more so than Marlon Brando in the title role, albeit a small one. But the most underrated role and actor in both the Godfather movies is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.
Excellent adult move. Love the music. I could have watched this all day long. Perfect length, if anything too short. Marlon Brando really defines the role of an Italian mafioso patriarch. I permanently learned the phrase, "make them an offer they can't refuse." Al Pacino gives another brilliant performance as the son who get drawn into his father's business, bit by bit. Then, Al Pacino becomes his father to continue his work. Al Pacino's character becomes even more ruthless a godfather than Marlon Brando. Robert Duvall, the family lawyer, gives a brilliant performance as one who at first comes off like a lamb but is really a lion in disguise. Diane Keaton plays a predictable character but gives an OK performance. The musical score is memorable. Just thinking about the movie brings to mind the musical score second to the character, the Godfather played by Marlon Brando. So powerful!
Best Movie ever, i have watched this movie with 5 of my friend last monday when i was in sulamaniyah, it was the best, and i am also planning to watch it with my wife next friday when im back to erbil.
I find this movie a little bit boring at some part but u will enjoy it if u like gangster thriller type movie. A classic movie The acting in this movie is top class I enjoyed this movie basically due to those top class acting
This movie is the best movie i have watched so far. I would recommend this movie to all of you people must have a look on it once this is insane.

In an interview with the Dailytimes, Sheth Jeebun talked about the importance of sustainability and the impacts of overconsumption of carbohydrates on the human body. He said that he makes all the Aster Health Care homes completely paper-free with technology to reduce the carbon footprints.
The Godfather (1972) was voted number 1 by Entertainment Weekly's readers in 1999 and voted as number 1 in a Time Out readers' poll in 1998. The film was voted the "Greatest Movie of All Time" in September 2008 by 10,000 readers of Empire magazine, 150 people from the movie business, and 50 film critics.
Spectacular Movie and The Godfather is my Favourite Film and Al Pacino is a great actor and I like Marlon Brando Acting in the Godfather film. The world's greatest movie is Godfather and World's Greatest Actor is Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

This film is pretty much one of those perfect movies. I see nothing wrong with this amazing film. The acting is fantastic, the score is excellent, the writing is great, and the cinematography is beautiful. When people think perfection in film making they usually either think "Citizen Kane" or this. It is expertly told story that spans through many years. The characters are great, and the relationships they have feel real. The story unfolds excellently, and by the time it is over you felt like you were part of the film. It is without a doubt the most influential crime drama ever made. This film is pure artistry at its finest.

4 stars out of 4
Its a good movie but it doesnt deserve the place for second best rated movie. I have seen much much better movies with 7 rate or 8.

Ever since i watched this movie i have loved it, every detail of the movie keeps me intrigued. Its sad in todays society that many people cant sit through such an amazing movie because they get bored so easily. Everyone needs to be constantly entertained, if you are a person like that you shouldn't watch this movie. If you love movies and have a fine appreciation for it you will find this to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting is brilliant, the music keeps you dazzled and the drama keeps you into the movie the whole way through. After i saw this movie i had to see every Al Pacino film and i think this may have been his best performance of his career, and Francis Ford Copla set a standard with movie making, one which i hope to follow in my quest to become a director and a screen writer.
There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

I guess we have all seen the movie, but at the moment I am writing an essay about it, and therefore seeing it over and over, and I must say, it is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made.... However, Godfather part II is close.... See it, and you want to be a gangster
Simply put, this is a very poor movie. The acting was substandard... Marlon Brando stuffs his cheeks, giving himself a speech impediment which is almost unavoidable and does not make for an amazing performance, and Al Pacino walks around with a blank, emotionless face throughout the entire movie (which is the point at some times, but not the whole time). Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds. The closest explanation I've gotten from anyone I've talked with in person about why this film is so great to them is because "it's the Godfather."

A movie that puts you to sleep and is not exciting or interesting does not belong as the greatest movie of all time to me.
A young director (Coppola) took by paramount with no big experience and a young protagonist (Al Pacino) with no big experience too, together they realized the greatest movie never made! Taken by the Mario Puzo's book, the Godfather isn't a really mafia story but, overall, is a story of a family, of a man who live for make it stronger and more powerful who finished to ruin it with his same hands... A story of cruel moments and a story of heart's tears too... Now, thirty years later it still be the greatest motion picture never done, with a screenplay with no equals, a cast strong, powerful and good-acting and with a love inside that isn't scary of the present and the future of the cinema.... All the trilogy is great, (overall the second godfather), almost 9 hours of intense emotions! I'm proud to give it 10! And now you can find it in dvd version too, with a special edition very special: godfather (1 disc), godfather II (2 disc) and godfather III (1 disc) with a extraordinary special contents too... where you can find all -and I mean ALL- about this movie we'll never forget for the rest of our life and life that we will live in the future!
This one is the classic family movie. They just happen to be murderers and gangsters and businessmen. This is the movie that taught all non-gangsters how that world really is and what it is like to be involved with the family. Some of the best crew was put together, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton to name a few and it was all brilliantly directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
This is the classic gangster film, it has everything, love, violence, great acting, and a great cast and director. I think this will continue to be a classic for many years. It is such a brilliant film and i recommend that everybody that has the opportunity to, to watch it.
I appreciate this movie as a very good piece of cinema but i really cant understand why its #1 in the Top250.

Ok the performances are solid, the direction is fluid and the story tight, but it isn't one of those movies you leave the theatre feeling your life is changed or anything like that...

Greatest movie of all time? I think not.
Can someone please explain to me why this film is held in such high regard? I couldn't see anything particularly good about it to be honest and I'm not one for finding fault normally but I would have to say that this is a badly directed, dragging film with unconvincing story and acting. Honestly, you'd think someone else would have noticed before it got to the movie house, wouldn't you? If I could only use 10 words to describe this film they would be: Lame, Pedestrian, and Not as good as you think it is. So come on film buffs, let's admit the game is up, you've been found out.
Wow, Absolutely amazing film. A wonderful cast of actors.
I consider this movie as one of the best movies of all time and used to watch it on tv and I was really excited to re-watch the 50 years old movie in cinema ! And to be honest this is the best re-release I have ever seen.

50 years old movie with better quality than modern some modern movie Recommendation: go and watch it in the cinema..it's a masterpiece hands down.

Could it get any better than the Godfather? Classic film with iconic plot twists, incredible performances and an overall feeling of "familia"...no wonder it stands the test of time. The performers were at the top of their games in this one. Maybe they should make a modern- day follow up. I mean, they are remaking everything else. Why not? Need a writer? Let me know! :)
If there was a zero out of 10, that's what I'd give it.

I know so many people hear the movie title, "The Godfather" and automatically feel like praising that movie, that whole trilogy, to the high heavens. Well, I don't care if it was made well...apart from how it was made, the movie was bad and I'm still upset that my philosophy teacher made me suffer through the whole trilogy. Boring...slow...just plain snooze-ville.

I'm probably going to have an angry mob coming after me for speaking of the movie this way, but it's my opinion...and I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling this way.
At first I didn't like the godfather but after forcing myself to sit through a rewatch gotta say not Half bad
progression of the movie follows the development of the following linear, logical sequenced story lines – Don Corleone is shot; Michael seeks retaliation by shooting Sollozzo and McClusky; The mafia family wars begin with a parallel story of Michael taking refuge in Italy; Don Corleone holds a peace summit between the families; Michael returns to America and becomes the new family Don upon his father's death. This is a standard "cause and effect" progression with each scene logically leading to the next having characters with differing goals clashing, and obtaining help from other characters to resolve conflicts and meet their ultimate goals. As a result, the characters' individual actions as well as group interaction help move the movie along.
Although rave reviews, but bluntly speaking, the traces of this film era are too obvious. It should be classified as an old-time movie before the watershed of a certain era. The plot, setting, performance, rhythm... Basically all aspects have reached a very high standard with the standard evaluation at the time. But at the same time, it is also greatly limited to the framework of old-time movies. If measured by modern life rhythms and aesthetic habits, the film's plot and rhythm are long and tedious, the performance is deliberate and formal, and the amount of information is not large... In short, it is not good-looking.
People lately have been having heated debates about TDK and the Godfather. Which is better? Everyone has their opinion, and I start my review with a Latin proverb: De Gustibus non Disputandum est. This means you can't argue with taste.

My opinion is that the godfather is a movie of great quality, however, there are other movies, TDK, for instance which are more entertaining.

Its similar to how in high school, they make you read all those dreadful "classics" To Kill a Mockinbird, Fahrenheit 451, The Great Gatsby, Macbeth, Hamlet... etc. Even though Harry Potter might be exponentially more exciting than this list of classics, it doesn't have that much literary value. Was it an enjoyable read? Of course. But I won't be telling my grandkids all the lessons harry potter taught me.
Overrated. At least I can finally stop wasting money on melatonin now though, I'll just turn this movie on and be asleep within 3 minutes. That's the only reason it's getting more than 1 star.
It feels more like a documentary than a movie, a documentary on family history. This movie super-passed the original novel, it reminds me of Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude".
The Godfather is a pointless, noisy, mindless, violent excuse for a film. It just seems to be an excuse to use the 'f' word for three hours. The acting is terrible and there is no story to be seen whatsoever. It seems to have been written by a three year old child. I give this film a 1/10 and that is being generous.
The Best "Mob Movie" Of All Time. It Will Make You An Offer That You Can't Refuse.
This is hands down the greatest movie of all time. Great story. Great thematic elements. Great acting. Great cinematography and editing. Fabulous. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, Talia Shire...perhaps the greatest cast ever assembled.

I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry! Oh my God. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience. Its tremendous work done. This movie depicts the sincere work with lots of love. No one can bring out such an epic movie, even if paid a billion dollars each. I just get up every time I hear Godfather to watch time and again.
The greatest movie of all time.

The Godfather is the most memorable, most influential, most quoted, most beloved, most discussed, most imitated, most revered and most entertaining American movie ever made.
I just recently viewed the Godfather and while I find it an enjoyable movie, there is no way it deserves the #1 rank in the top 250 movies of all time. The plot is not that involved and the movie is a bit to long and drags in several scenes. I found myself wondering when it was going to end and that is not the sign of a great movie.
I watched the godfather twice now and still dont like it i watched it with my dad 4 months ago did not like it watched it with my whole family 2 months ago still dont like it i guess i just dint like these movies like goodfellas and the godfather because all ths characters are terrible people

If you wanna define this movie in a word, it would simply be 'Masterpiece', ridiculously flawless and extraordinary. The Godfather isn't a movie, but a piece of art, which make you feel the characters and their emotions, everytime they appear on screen. The screenplay and direction, both are simply flawless, intriguing, charismatic and definitive. The characters are very well written and potrayed in the most delicate way. The Original Score for the movie is gorgeous and bridges between characters and their emotions. It is simply the best score I have ever heard till date in a motion picture. In a movie with deep characters along with a great story, the performances by actors are marvelous. Al Pacino, Brando everyone is awesome giving life to the story. For a movie, about 3 hrs long, The Godfather provides edge of seat experience.

STORY - 10/10 PERFOM. - 10/10 MUSIC - 9.5/10 CINEMATOGRAPHY - 9.5/10 DIRECTION - 10/10 OVERALL - 10/10
Well what superlatives can i give a movie that probably has had them all. This film is and will remain a classic in any era. Up step Al Pacino, from virtually nowhere this actor, amongst a frighteningly illustrious cast, absolutely blows them away and gives a performance that has given him legendary status.

Everything about this movie, form the acting, to the direction to the sound track is perfect in every sense of the word. Most people that have not seen the movie will probably think of it as a classic gangster movie, but it so much more then that, family, love, romance, revenge all this in one movie is truly remarkable.

For me this movie is my all time favourite it gets better every time I watch it and it rightly deserves to be at the top of the all time movies
I don't typically like gangster mob films. I tried this film because I thought it would be a good film to see as a student studying film. I didn't like it and I guess I should have known I wouldn't. Cheers to those who do.
"The Godfather" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil
Fine if no one is saying anything I will this movie is overrated I understand why people THAT time (1970s) liked it back then it was something new and probably the most realistic movie they got back THEN but honestly there is SO MANY movies that are WAY better though I do understand why MEN liked it but honestly I've been watching movies from a very young age and this movie wasn't even mid it was low the idea is SO basic and old and yeah you will say it's an old movie in the 70s and that's why you need to let it go you just like it because it old and old fashioned how about you move on from OH THOESE WERE THE GREATER DAYS and start get nostalgic people who are like this need to move to actually better movies with better plot and actually more realistic in OUR time and honestly it was SO misogynistic and I just lost 3 hours of my life in trash.
Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told.
The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): "Don't ever take sides against the family." Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece.

Most film critics say that 'The Godfather' is one of the greatest films of all time, and I agree with them.

First of all, i'd like to say this is Marlon Brando's best performance yet! Al Pacino had a stupendous performance too, alongside legends like Robert Duvall and James Caan.

The writing was good all-in-all which made it an Oscar, the violent scenes were action packed but blood baths (so don't watch it with children). Francis Ford Coppola did everything to make this a great movie so kudos to him.

All-in-all this is a must see movie before you die, I hope there will be more movies as good as this.
The movie is more than worth watching, it is one of the classic movies of the American cinematography. Al Pacino is as always great. And the story, the atmosphere and the spirit of Italian-American neighborhoods, of "old school" mafia, "La Cosa Nostra", was transferred amazingly great. You shall see lots of interesting stuff about Italian Mafia traditions, about their Code, that used to value back in the days. In my humble opinion, the second part (The Godfather II) is not as good as this one, and you should definitely see at least this. I remember I first heard of this movie from my grandfather. And if he advised the movie, it meant that it's good indeed. This one was not an exception.


I honestly don't get how this movie is so highly rated... it is extremely slow and boring. The only saving grace was Marlon Brando's performance in the film, apart from that, this film literally did nothing. From someone who loves a good gangster movie, this movie was absolute garbage. Movies like Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos way and Scarface are all amazing films and make this movie seem like a lullaby because it's enough to put you to sleep with its extremely slow and gentle pace. The movie runs for appeox 3 hours and going outside and watching the grass grow would be a more exciting thrill that sitting through this absolutely overrated disaster.
I don't want to talk too much, but the spontaneity of the performance, made me witness to what happened.

I consider myself lucky to stay a life.

A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines ("I'll make him an offer he can't refuse") have become legendary.
I am 19 years old, but I've been seeing and listening about this movie my whole life, so I finally sat and watched it. And it is astonishing by the fact, that what turns the movie to be so good is, the most common, usual, old conversations (knowing what that conversation will lead to). I enjoy Mafia movies since day one, so watching this masterpiece was like playing Mafia games. The Godfather has on hands an incredible cast. I do believe Al Pacino was born to portray mobsters in Mafia movies, and you clearly see how good he is, since the Dinosaurs age. (old times if you didn't understand what supposed to be a "joke").
Sorry, but after all the hype between LOTR_vs_Godfather debate, I decided to check this film out. Being a huge fan of LOTR for many years, I wanted to see it from THEIR perspective. But I was expecting SO much more - what did I get? An uninspiring 'epic'. Where was the storytelling? Where was the superb direction. And I know what i'm talking about when it comes to GOOD films (A Clockwork Orange, The Pianist, The Great Escape, The Elephant Man, The Evil Dead and any Ray Harryhausen masterpiece...) and this doesn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, I love gangstar films - but not this one. Sorry, this isn't the 'greatest' movie of all time. Go rent SPY KIDZ II or something... I can't understand how this compares and tops the movie list...everyone i've spoken too (apart from my mate Justin) hates this film. If it was THAT good, everyone would own it on DVD which they don't ... go figure...
Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant
I recently saw the godfather again, 34 times I think. Now, never was a Brando fan, can't stand mob movies, so why should I like this one? Simply, because everyone else does. Its not that the acting's bad (except for brando) its not that its a mob movie, OK, it is that it is a mob movie. I mean seriously, pick a better topic! Not a realistic view of the mob. The mob did things quietly never have I heard in history of a mobsters getting gunned down in his car by many bullets. Oh, and another thing, if this movie is supposed to be realistic, why did the gas can blow up when the shot the car?

Only see this movie if you love mob movies and love brando

This movie is excellent! Probably the best I've ever seen the props are very good minding the year it was released and the acting is out of this world. I've read the book before and after watching the movie and I tell you the second time was much better! It was like the pictures the book tried to create came out alive as I've seen the in the movie and it was really cool. They did put a lot of effort to this movie and it does pay off, as the scenery and the costumes and everything is so detailed. Of course the atmosphere of the movie is marvelous and really travels you back to the 40s spot on! You should totally see this movie, or better watch the whole trilogy. It is must!
This film is truly epic, develops the characters in an amazing way, especially to Don Corleone, that he does in the film as a superior to all, with more knowledge and intelligence, based on their sense of friendship and favors. I love this kind of movies in which the protagonists or antagonists are complex beings, with ambitious and colossal ideas, and that not anyone could do. The conclusions of every act and decision that Don Corleone, or of his son, are amazing, doing all to the big, I consider at all of one of the best movies that I see in all my life, and I will never forgot the sound-track and the landscape, that is the final complement that does the movie unforgettable.

There will be a before and after THE GODFATHER in the movie history, and I will also say in the real life Mafia, Cosa Nostra way of life, from the inside. The screenplay was inspired by a nover written by Mario Puzo, himself helped by a very accurate documentation on this sensitive subject. Before THE GODFATHER, there were two awesome films about the true mafia: Richard Wilson's PAY OR DIE and Richard Thorpe's THE BLACK HAND, starring...Gene Kelly. Back to THE GODFATHER, the funniest is that after this movie, the Mafia goons and leaders were hemselves inspired by the film.... It is purely awesome in any sense, from any angle where you can see it. Acting, directing, editing too; and this for both films GODFATHER ONE and TWO. Thousands of films will try to copy it, with more or less success; as there will also thousands of films trying to copy other films - also starring Al Pacino ( what a coincidence) : SCARFACE, HEAT, ....It is brutal, bloody, poignant, even for the most squeamish audience. Anyone can love this film, or at the least appreciate it.
Best movie in the world. It could be called the best movie ever. Although years have passed, no better has been done...

While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Any good story teller knows it's not what you say, but how you say it.

By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two time lines converge. The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie. This has two advantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely, and secondly you don't have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better follows that of Lenny.
I watched this movie very late. You now, there is one quote "Old but gold". This is cliche but this quote equals to this movie. Atmosphere, music, actors, actress, cinematography, dialogue, writing, everythink are fantastic.

10 / 10.
Just paying my tribute here. Francis Ford Coppola made with The Godfather (my favorite one of the trilogy) nothing less than one of the best movies of all time and the benchmark of the genre. Everything is just excellent and timeless. Still fantastic after all those years.

I had always thought this movie was overrated before I had watched it, it truly deserves its rating. I usually get bored when watching dialogue scenes in movies but I didn't even flinch watching this masterpiece, even gave me goosebumps. The music is also playing an important role in making this movie perfect.

Best film I ever watched
I know because I knew a mob guy. This is Hollywood's glorification of the worst possible life to choose. Phenomenal acting, but the life of a mob guy is violent and depraved (and often broke). The most realistic mob movie I have ever seen is Donnie Brasco. This is what mob life is really like. Mob life is about a million miles from being romantic. Carlito's Way is another realistic (more or less) look at street crime life. you watch this movie for the phenomenal acting, not for realism in any way. Hollywood loves to capitalize off stories of gangsters, glorify it up a bit, and package it as if it were real. What's real is busting your hump, not making enough in a month so you have to sell dope, and wondering if there is a gun at your head every second of the day. to be honest, I'd rather sell staplers.
Saying this film is almost as good as Godfather II is not a knock in any way. It is a great film. It is like comparing a BMW with a Mercedes. Both are great luxury cars, and both have several million diehard fans; just as this film and Godfather II have their admirers. I personally prefer Godfather II and a BMW. But back to the film. Brando is great, Pacino is great, Caan is intense, Keaton is good, Shire is good, and Duvall is perfect in his role. This was before napalm was invented, though. The story is riveting, and every scene is a masterpiece of filmmaking. I particularly enjoyed when Caan beat up his brother in law. I never had male in-law problems like that. However, I could have used Caan for one of mother in laws. A film for the ages.

It is my favorite movie, I saw it many times with my family

The title says it all.I absaloutly adore this film.Some say part II is the best but I wouldn't really agree.Excellent performances from Marlon Brando,Al Pacino and James Caan as the Family.The perfect film for a Friday night,and a Saturday etc
This to me is the second greatest mafia, gangster, movie of all time, behind Goodfellas. Perhaps one could argue that since the GF came first it should take the title as the best, but I'm not making that argument.

Its a bit of a shame that so many parody's and jokes have come about over time because in a way it cheapens what is something quite special.

Brilliant script/story, well paced, filled to the brim with acting megastars all backed up by a beautiful score.

A cool classy masterwork.
What can I say? I gave this thing a 1 because I honestly have never felt it was all that good. I that saw the average was a 9 at the time I voted and I felt the dissenters should get some representation. Brando isn't all that great in it. I mean the thing is better than the average film (at least I'm supposed to believe that), but 9 out of 10!? No way. Watch different movies. In fact, watch other coppala movies. I personally like 'The Outsiders' and 'The Conversation' better. I find the story to be boring. I also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish. I won't go into detail on this. I will just say the thing left me dry.
Simply amazing. This is probably the only 3 hour movie I would ever watch
The godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much. The roles of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated. The direction is good not excellent, the script is by no means ground breaking. But many people still refer to it as the best film ever made. Next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and wit(eg fight club) and more lavish directing.
. . . why this movie gets such high ratings. It's a great story, but Coppola's criminal lack of attention to detail and continuity is insulting and Talia Shire's, James Caan's, Marlon Brando's and Diane Keaton's amateurish performances are distracting and laughable. Neither of them can act at all. Watch it again and I'm sure you'll agree.

If you want to write something about this movie, either you write a complete separate novel, to express everything, or you just write 6 words: One Of The Best Movies Ever! But not the best movie for Marlon Brando. No, there is no "Apocalypse Now" neither! By far Brando is much better in: "Morituri" (1965), "Candy" (1968) and, absolutely phenomenal (especially in the scene when he's talking to his wife's dead body) in "Last Tango in Paris"(1972). All the other actors are super exceptional: James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Morgana King (Mother Corleone). But, in my opinion, the best actor in the movie is Al Lettieri in the role of Sollozzo.
Same story could be filmed much shorter.. Unnrcessarly long. In 3 hours very few things happen actually. Despite very long duration, there are still many disconnections among timelines.
What can be said about godfather that hasnt already been said,godfather is simply one of best films ever made and a must watch for everyone that shares love for movies,godfather has everything incredible cast and performances ,iconic music,great story and grow of characters and their life in criminal world,quateable dialogue with a lot of strong lessons in life we can learn and overall great direction and filmmaking in every way,godfather is simply a masterpiece and i think that this film will been seen and admired in future by many generations to come and they will love this film as much as we love it today
Now I know this movie is the national pride of America, but I can't help it, it's a blown up, too long, stupid movie. Now you can say oh he's sixteen, he does know anything about movies, well you're wrong!



Everything about this film, every aspect, is absolutely perfect. You have an amazing storyline that contains stellar writing, some of the best acting out there, a beautiful score, etc.. There are genuinely 0 flaws with this movie. It is a stunning piece of cinema that every film lover needs to watch at least once.
What can I write about this movie that you don't already know,released in 72 and still to this day the greatest Mafia movie made, strong cast and strong Scripts and when you have that combination you have a hit on your hands that can never be bettered, at the end the quote of the movie,Connie to Michael"did you kill him ," did you kill him Michael? he shouts back " never ask me about my business" then the pause and then the Answer " NO " she walks out and the door slowly closes and the audience cannot wait for more until we got GodFather 2, THAT IS FOR ANOTHER DAY,Al Pacino comes into his own in this movie and as for Marlon Brando excellent performance,I only wished they kept him alive a little for GodFATHER 2,

I can't believe I've lived so long without watching this. It uses every frame of its time to humanize then destroy a family, making their trade and income unimportant, and changing the world of film in the process. One of the best ever, period.
Love this movie and all of the GF movies It is indeed the most classic film history, each shot, each line, is so delicate and rich in meaning. People should spend more time watching this movie.
Men must watch! The Shawshank Redemption and Godfather are like two sides of a man. Freedom and constraint are actually the same thing.
A magnificent work of art! Timeless. Exposes all the strength and human weakness, the true meaning of family in all aspects.
What can I say? This is easily one of the greatest movies ever made. Not just because the acting and everything is on point, but because Brando pushes it over the edge. There is no argument about it, Marlon Brando is the greatest actor of all time, and not just because of what he does in this film but for nearly every film he has been in. And his later films are all the better because at that point, he more or less mastered his craft. But yeah, The Godfather is an excellent film. The secret behind it, other than Brando's acting is the story. It isn't a crime story but a tale about a family; most people can not wrap their heads around such a concept.


The original and best. Marlon Brando was phenomenal in this role. Great supporting cast from everyone all round. The cinematography makes this the perfect piece of American nostalgia. Classic story perfectly executed.
The best movie ever, such a talented actor Brando was
Without any doubt there is nothing compare to this movie... I don't have enough words to say how good is this movie.
Im sorry but I can't stand these movies, I tired multiple times to watch them, they're so boring and predictable. There's nothing to them, I don't understand how they have such a high rating.
Best film ever ive never seen. All of them are incredible. must watch
ALL TIME GREATS COME TOGETHER ON THIS ONE LOVE IT. I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN A MOVIE WE ALL GREAT ACTORS AROUND ME MAKING A CLASSIC FILM WIT THERE SPECIAL TALENTS IN IT WHY NOT .
It will not take very long: The Godfather is just...THE MOVIE. It's not my favorite movie, it's not the funniest movie I've ever seen or that of which I remember the dialogues as if I had studied them, but there's no single movie since 1972 (and maybe before) that hasn't taken something of it. It's poetry in motion, it's tender, wild, violent...again, it's THE MOVIE.
What a truly special movie this is. Despite its violence, heavy content, and length, I could literally watch it every week. This film contains some of the most tragic, well-devoloped characters in the history of American cinema; they are simply unforgettable. Then there are the masterful performances, the beautiful cinematography and art direction, the wonderful script, etc., etc. In short, this is one of the most perfect stretches of celluloid ever.

Classic, contemporary, contemporary, fantastic What to say more about a film that perfectly portrays a system that existed and exists until today?! Congratulations on the job. And watch it, a must for any movie lover.




Cuenta una gran historia, cuenta con un buen elenco muy recomendada
the Godfather is one of the best films you will ever see. This is an entralling tail of an aging mobster who must choose from his sons a successor to his position. Having only recently seen the film for the first time, and then reading Mario Puzo book, you see how well most characters were transferred to the screen. Sonny, Michael, Freddy, Clemenza, Tom, Tessio, Johnny and Kay to name but a few were all well acted and true to the book (Though Johnny Fontaine's part was cut down severely). The only exceptions were the Don himself (Pure Marlon Brando, De Niro did a much better job of playing Vito Corleone in Godfather II) and Luca Brasi, who was hardly the scary underground hitman of the book.

This film is a must see.
the worst movie by one of the greatest director. I rented this movie because of the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed with the garbage i wasted my time on. No Plot to hold on to throughout the movie.
I like Mafia movies, I think Scarface and Goodfellas, two masterpiece, but The Godfather was never much of my taste, I find the movies very good, but not him and 2 are not movies that would speak that are better than the story , The initial scene of the film is excellent, has heavy moments, excellent dialogues, a very good script, the direction of Coppola is great, the truth is that Coppola is an excellent director, unfortunately he made more bad movies than good, the cast Is great, Al Pacino at the beginning of his movie boom, and Marlon Brando does one of the best performances of all time, from an excellent character that is Don Corleone, I think the film is very big, so the rhythm falls a little , The soundtrack is excellent, the photography is very good, The Godfather is an excellent film, even if I do not find a masterpiece, its quality and contribution to the cinema is undeniable. Note 8.7
This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers.
Watching this classic in a theater only solidifies it's place as my #1 all-time favorite film.

Not a false note in the film. The setting is superb, the mood is subtle and effective, the music adds to the feelings.

But the acting...oh, the acting!

Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Casales, Keaton, Vigoda all at the top of their games.

But...Brando...on another level entirely as Don Vito Corleone. A performance for the ages.

Bravo...everyone...Bravo!
Simply put, The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. If you haven't seen it, then you don't know what you are missing. This film (and II & III) will stand the test of time for generations to come. You have to get the complete DVD Set, it is priceless. Take Care... Chad Castorina
Confusing, but the action and suspense are great. Plus, I love the cautionary implications against mafia life.
Dom: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse: FAMILY

The trilogy began. It's a story about family, revenge, and heritage in a mafia family in New York. The first half was a bit slow with many scenes that I felt lingered a bit too long. However, I loved Marlon Brando as The Godfather. The way he looked and acted was cool and conveyed a respected boss. I'm not entirely convinced on Al Pacino's character's transition, still in the second half his character became significantly better and more commanding. Of course the ending was awesome and showed the ironic way that Al Pacino's character changed. Overall it's a great first third. 8/10.
What needs to be said about Coppola & Puzo's sprawling crime epic? It redefined the language of cinema and permanently altered the pop culture landscape. It is what it is. Rewatching it for the first time as an adult though I found myself suddenly wrapped in these amazingly sharp layers of meaning about crime, the nature of society and the endless back-and-forth of violence and civility. Of course, this was already present, I'd just never seen it properly. I don't necessarily believe that it's dated terribly well, or that every single moment of it is perfectly constructed but that a film this highly lauded and well-trodden is still so gripping and intriguing is testament enough, surely?

Without doubt, The Godfather is an excellent movie. The acting, script, mood, music, cinematography and an indefinable haunting quality, all make for one of the finest movies ever made.

However, I believe that the Godfather 2 is an even greater film. In fact, I consider it to be the best film I have ever seen. The last poignant moment of the movie with Michael Corleone in reflective mood, is in my opinion, one of the classic scenes in cinematic history. That one scene has always remained with me and I always associate it with this movie. I was pleased to see that this scene was also included in the most memorable moments in movie history at a recent Academy Awards ceremony.
I've been in the rare position as a cinephile to have never watched The Godfather. I've been in the even rarer position of being an Italian-American cinephile that has never watched The Godfather. That has now thankfully changed. I can cross off my bucket list, at least, the first installment of this treasured film franchise. To millions, it's the greatest film of all time. To filmmakers and film lovers, the experience alone is a pilgrimage. To Italians in America, it's a vital piece of our history, for better or worse. It's an epic tragedy about absolute power, vengeance, violence as a means to an end and the traditions of a family through generations. Vito Corleone passes it all down to his son, Michael and with it, the price of his soul. But to Michael, there is no price. His soulless brown eyes say it all. He's fully consumed by power by the film's end. It's corrupting influence be dammed. I could go on, but frankly, I don't need to. The Godfather speaks for itself.
If you admire this film, then you owe it to yourself to read about the making of the film and the odds against which Coppola wrestled to get his vision of how Puzo's story should be filmed on the screen. Doing this will only deepen your respect for both the movie and its makers.

This movie is simply the best gangster movie of all time and one of the greatest movies in cinema history from the very beginning every character is believable, every speech sounds authentic and every scene draws you deeper and deeper into the story.

The big name stars in this movie put in incredible performances. If you like movies put his on your must see list, if you like mobster movies buy it now.
This is probably my favourite ever film, many say that Part 2 is better but I find that not quite the case. Although Part 2 has a deeper plot and the 2 different time frames, Part 1 is better simply because of the Brando character. Vito Corleone is one of the most recognisable characters ever on-screen and its Brando's performance that I really like.
The best movie ever, and if you're reading do not agree with it, you have bad taste. Of course you can not agree with me, but you have to admit it's a really good movie. The film has a fantastic story, with good characters, good soundtrack and good director. Highly recommend. A movie that everyone should see at least once in their lives.
This one is good but not a 10/10 (at least for me) It's to slow paced just is too long for what is actually happening And after this movie I just feel exhausted it feels like work and not entertainment Maybe it was a revelation back then but if you watch this in your 20s for the first time you may be dissapoited sorry
This Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is perfect in so many levels that it's hard to put it into words. It is such a great character study and the performances by Brando, Pacino and Duvall help make it the classic that it is.
Might be a lot of people's favourite but I can't gel with this picture. And I've tried!
Well... believe it or not, this weekend was the first time I actually sat down and watched the Godfather all the way through. Sure, it's great, but I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites of all time. It does have a timeless quality, however, and brilliant nuances, even in the most in-your-face scenes. I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, though I was probably the last one who hadn't seen it.
I had the pleasure of Rewatching "The Godfather" with my friends for the first time on the Big screen, a movie theatre here in morocco offered us this masterpiece in 4K and we couldn't refuse, and man oh man what a Magnificent experience that was.
This movie was great. The movie had a great cast and an amazing story line. It showed how a person can really change after something really bad happened in their lives. I was in a history class last year and I never realised how horrible these years really were(with the gangs, like Al Capone) This movie was really great!!
I have recently watched Godfather again and my initial opinion did not change. There is a story but characters are superciliously described. In some cases they do not relate to the story completely. The competition among rival gangsters should have been better described to the audience.

There are other movies also leaves an uncompleted feeling at the end of it, but this one is different. The main components of a movie is missing,a lacking integrity included at its ending.

Ladies and gentleman, I admit it could make a few good entry episodes for a gangsters TV series, which it did in a way in the long run but overall, this movie deserves nothing close to its current position in the IMDb top movies list.


After 50 years, this movie is still going strong! The cast produced a superb performance. Ford Coppola made it all possible. I can watch this movie again and again...A Masterpiece for many more years to come.
Timeless! A masterpiece of cinematography, that encompasses almost all branches of human sentiment in real life situations.


A realistic and shocking portrait of how the mafia acted in the 1940s. A priceless masterpiece. Marlon Brando in a perfect performance, leaving a mark in cinema as one of the most respected and acclaimed characters by the public and critics.

The Godfather... 3 Oscars... NONONONONONONONONO!!!!!!! This film (And its others) Is THE worst piece of rubbish i have ever endured!

I feel that it was an insult to my backside who was forced to grow carbuncles under the weight of such mafia slush. the acting is terrible, the premise is horrible and the time is awful.

They made more than 1? yes. were any of them good (and i'm not biased, i always watch things till the end to get a full view... i even watched the others although i hated it) no.. all awful, all too long, need i say more?

My view -10/10
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film.


There is a reason why this movie is so highly rated: It truly is a work of art. I consider this a cinematic masterpiece. Is it long? Yes. Is that necessary to fully tell this story? Absolutely. Everyone brings their A-game and that's what makes it feel so real. The score is beautifully done and made me want to open a bottle of wine to enjoy while watching this movie. I don't want this to be a spoiler review so I won't talk about character arcs, but the ones that do happen are so good. A must watch for any cinephile out there.
The best movie ever?... I beg to disagree. Also, not quite the best film of 1972. Beg to disagree as I remember enjoying the following ones more

Deliverance Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie Frenzy The Getaway Solyaris Cabaret L'amour l'après-midi Avanti!

Ballet Adagio What's Up, Doc?
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
This is a brilliant film. This has absolutely no flaw. The story is narrated perfectly and the thrill grows with each scene. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have played their roles so perfectly that you end up mesmerized by their act. A Textbook for all actors, writers and directors.


A film that has stood the test of time. Marlon Brando is brilliant in this film so many iconic scenes and marlon Brando steals the show.

A flawless epic with mastery to be found in all parts, a true cinema classic.
To man: don't remember to hate your opponent, it will make you lose your mind.
First read the novel and then watch it . Both are fantastic . But I prefer the novel . Marlon Brando's best performance ever. Al Pacino was great . Coppola made it nicely .

It is the best movie ever made in Hollywood . Probably the best movie on the previous century . It indicates how important can be a family bond . Vito Corleone's quotes - I gonna make him an offer he can't refuse made him more special to me .
The Godfather film is an excellent movie WHY? because of the drama, action and the loyalty.

The movie describes how it could be in a mafia family, both on family problems and political problems. The Godfather also gives you a picture of how a man with respect could be as Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone.

Alsow did the movie learned me something, that always love your family no matter what.

The movie haves good actors as Al Pacino and Marlyn. not only that it haves also good actions and original scenes!
Pretty good movie, its enjoyable, it works.

I love crime movies, if you like crime movies, you'll like this movie too.
It's considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic; it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff, it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes, and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion. You got tits and glamourized gangster machismo for the men, and scenic rural Italy for the women.

It would be obvious how paper-thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didn't propel it into something approaching three- dimensionality. I think I prefer Goodfellas because it deconstructs everything this movie is, and is a much more natural, interesting movie in the process.
Easily Marlon Brando's best performance. James Caan's best performance, and Al Pacino steals the show. Al Pacino's performance is not as good as the one from Dog Day Afternoon, but still up there as his second best performance. Arguably Robert Duval's best performance ever. Off course we must mention Al Pacino's dear friend (also from Dog Day Afternoon), who plays his older brother Fredo, John Cazale; an amazing performance, that he will top in Godfather II. I also need to mention that Johnny Fontane, played by Al Martino, is most likely based on, or at least inspired by, Frank Sinatra... And we need to mention the iconic music, the only score that ever came close to Ennio Moricone's music. In fact the maestro, Ennio Morricone, performed that tune more then once. Some people call this movie the bible... That might be a bit cynical, but it simply is the most quoted movie ever. "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."
Yeah it's a good movie but I can't accept that this is regarded as the greatest film of all time...come on...there are a lot of films which is worth enough to reign the crown of being the greatest film of all time such as Shawshank redemption, Schindler's list and much more...but seriously cannot accept that this one is the best film of all time... whatever.... there's nothing much to say...but I really appreciate Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's performance it was actually great... that's all I wanna say.
Italian Mafia who kill and go rich; government takes their money. No credits to this cast and crew but at the Awards. The story did not need to ring a bell in memory but movie reviewers like to seat in chairs with no cushions and watch 'The Godfather'. Review to the movie is that the further research into films that is done; the analytic is that light their was impressionistic. The shoot in movies are with lights in the backdrop that are with people and barricades; no photography without permission. It is not allowed to publish or view these contents that are from backstage and the reasons are unavoidable because the crew spent their work in preserving that truth that should be viewed at cinema halls or in digital video devices. On the television the story of the 'Godfather' is featured with the set of box. Plugging in to the channel proves validly that watching 'The Godfather' starring Marlon Brando as 'Godfather' will not lead to him adopting a child from us. Recommending 'The Godfather' to viewers because it is a Marlon Brando film and books have been written on the former and latter.
Very good movie, no doubt!

However, I suspect a nostalgy bonus in the ratings.

Despite a 70s movie, you will find a very modern way of story telling, scripting, image recording and actor skills.

You won't feel as being watching an « old » movie.

Actions are held realistic, there is no exaggeration, which makes everything credible.

But honestly, there are many modern movies that get worse ratings but that are not less enjoyable.


Classic. Absolute classic.

I want to rewatch all The Godfather's now that I'm older.

But as an Italian, this is a damn good movie - along with its series counterparts.


My absolute favorite movie. I could watch it over and over again.


This is a good movie but not as great as everyone seems to think.

Certaintly not the number one movie in the top 250. Heat, in fact,

was much better than The Godfather. Pachino's acting was not so

very good and the plot was slightly sluggish. The whole time

where Pachino is 'away' is a blind alley of a plot line and only

serves to kill off his first wife that has no bearing on the plot really.

7/10
The Godfather. Cinema from which it is impossible to refuse. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo have created a truly iconic gangster movie! The Godfather is a story about how a person changes his views and becomes what he might have been destined to be. I would especially like to cancel the excellent cast and especially Marlon Brando, who played the boss of the criminal clan Corleone stern and at the same time smart, intelligent and able to think ahead.
I know everybody says the same thing but this truly is a masterpiece. There are so many truths in the film to real gansterism. like the raspy voice of don Vito is like that of Frank Costello's voice. The wedding at the start of the film is like the Bill Bonanno wedding and even the plot to kill the heads of the five main families at the end of thefilm is taken from Joe Bonanno so i think Mario Puzo knew a lot more about the mob than maybe we all first thought. But still an outstanding piece of film and the book is superb as well.
I'n not the great critic, I'm just a person, who loves cinema. If you are like me, you must watch this film. All features in it are on their place. Firstly, the story is based on Mario Puso's book, I really recommend to read it, and this film used almost all book, expect the storyline about young Vito (director used it in sequel). Secondly, all actors did the amazing performance: Brando, Al Pachino, Duvall and others created great film. Thirdly, music and costumes made the atmosphere of late 40s. So, it's really one of the greatest film ever. So,
I'll be honest, when I watched this film as a 16 year old I had given it a 5 on IMDb. Back then I found it long, slow and boring and wondered why it had such high ratings. What can I say? I was really dumb and stupid at that time. Now at 22, I feel so ashamed for my thoughts about this film in the past. This is a fricking Perfect film. Release in1972, I can only imagine what waves it must have created around the world back then. The characters, their development, the story, acting and everything are solid! Yes it is long and may feel slow paced, but I don't know how 3 hours passed by. An absolute Masterpiece!
What I don't understand is why so many think this is such a great film. The actors did great, but the whole story to me was boring. I like to see the bad guys get whats coming to them. I think a lot of the guys who watch this kind of idolize them and that's just sad to me. At least it seems that way. Maybe I just like my crime movies to have a more definitive hero. Someone I can root for to come out on top. There are mob/crime family movies I really like so I know its not just the genre I don't care for. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 10 is because the actors were good, otherwise I'd have given it a 1. This is just my opinion of course. I often disagree with critics and ratings so you should watch it and judge for yourself.
I finally understand why this film is said to be one of the greatest or the greatest film, it's writing is just top notch and really keeps u hooked the entire time. The godfather deserves to be in imdbs top ten. What I'm sad about is that we will never get a movie this well written ever again, cuz writers today don't want to think wen they write, they just rehash and remake. I really wish we could just switch the writers of this time and the amazing writers from back then with amazing originality, making films that made ppl think instead of spoon feeding them. A masterpiece, 10 out of 10, I will never forget this movie it's just that goof


The greatest movie of all time,this movie is masterpiece,legendary!
10/10 just to explain why. Maybe like yourself I was not totally sweeped in by just the high review and I always had a feeling it might just be dissappointing. Like I never got into some other mega hyped movies.

BUT this movie is genuinely a gem. Everything is done so exceptionally well.

Literally just finished watching it and it much better then de Goodfellas which is already a good movie.

Going to stop writing this review so I can starting watching PT2.
I have never been able to watch this movie to the end, tried to watch it couple of times and fell asleep everytime. I think this film is just too long and boring. I can't understand how can someone think it's the best movie ever.
I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! I have always loved movies on mafia and underworld. This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience.

MASTERPIECE!
the godfather is a timeless classic most ages can appreciate. the godfather is one of very few movies that have standed the test of time. the godfather is the best of the trilogy but the godfather pt II is very close but not just the main reason for this is because Marlon Brando isn't in the second part he is truely amazing in the godfather if he hadn't of won best actor oscar for it there would be alot of questions to ask. this was Al Pacinos third movie the previous two not getting him any recognition he changed all this by giving the performance of his life, and if you think hes good in this see part II and even though most reviewers say that part III is terrible i assure you it is not! true it is not as good as the previous 2 but Al Pacino should be enough of a reason to watch part III as he is, as always, amazing. so if you have seen the first Godfather but not the others then just buy the Godfather trilogy on d.v.d thats what i did.
I didn't grow up then but in the modern era having now watched this film it's no 10. The acting is overdone and the multiple characters dropping like flies makes it hard to keep up.
This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on.
I finally watch it after 48 years ! What an excellent movie , performance wise each and every character shine in their own way , the twist and turns were amazing !

Finish watching it today, I expect too much because of the reviews they say that this is the best and greatest movie ever but when i watch it it's good and watchable maybe it's just not my type of movie. But still It's fine to me, not too bad and not too good, the action and killings is brutal. FOR ME not the best movie but not the worst.
Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.
In the beginning, The Godfather was the classic from the beginning. Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. The Godfather along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito's line, "I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in a 2005 poll, called AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. It is often used in a humorous way. Reports from Mafia trials and confessions suggest that Mafia families began a "real life" tradition of paying respect to the family don by kissing his ring, in imitation of the ending scene of the movie. There is no evidence of this custom being mentioned prior to the movie.
This is awesome movie I enjoyed watching And it's the best movie ever Great job

The Godfather is a masterpiece that is almost so beloved that people have forgotten why. This movie has some of the best written dialogue ever put to screen. This movie is also unmatched in its acting, still being one of the greatest casts ever. On top of all of this there is a great story of someone becoming a family man even though that goes against what he previously thought moral. Micheal Corleone has one of the biggest character arcs of any character ever, he is a totally different man by the end of this movie. The Godfather is a timeless movie and inspired a generation of film.
Im not a huge fan of mafia movies and especially the ones that last 3 hours and more. I will admit that for its time 1972, The first installment of Godfather is fine with a good performance from Corleones. Took me a while to recognise Al Pacino there ... I liked the light part with the wedding and then the exact opposite that will provoke whats coming next. Nice directing with some realistic mafia thinking. I believe though that the next two might be better. It would be better if it lasted 2 20 minutes.

Wow! Let me say right off the bat that watching "The Godfather" is a hideous waste of time. After sitting through three laborious hours of terrible dialogue, pointless plot twists, and senseless violence I was thoroughly sickened. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando team up in what is surely one the most mindless, long winded, and utterly tiresome films of the century. Here's a tip: rent this film if you are big on self-torture. Or do yourself a favor and check out "Mulholland Falls" if you are into gangster films.
Rewatching the trilogy. Love the series.

We see Michael turn into everything that he was trying to avoid, but we're on his side even though he's a antihero.

Still amazes me that Simonetta Stefanelli was only 16 and doing a topless scene!

Can't wait to rewatch 2&3.
I can watch this movie over and over again... One of the best movies of all time. Every body's good in this movie especially Al Pacino. A true classic!
When I first watched the Godfather, I thought it was long, and overrated. I really didn't understand what the hype was for, and why this film is so critically acclaimed, being #2 on IMDB's top 250 movies. It was only over time when I was reminded by it, such as the visual look of Don Vito Corleone, or the iconic quotes such as "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse", that I began to realise that I had witnessed a masterpiece. The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in history, that has truly influenced our society. There's good story telling, distinct memorable characters, and a very good ending. I don't believe that it's the 2nd greatest film of all time, I think films such as Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange and American Beauty are better, but it's certainly deserved a top 10 spot. Believe the hype.
Marlon Brando is the Father of all actors when it comes to act as a don.

The novel(which is also great) has been converted beautifully into a movie. Every detail has been taken care of.

And what to say about Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), I became a fan f him after I watched the movie.

The background score is too good. I was wondering whether i can get it from somewhere.

All in all a great casting for the film.

The best mafia movie i have ever seen. better than its following two parts.
Sicilian Mafia working in America, the notorious head of the family, Don Corleone, fighting for the pride of the family. The epic mafia films pictured the mafia well, awesome.
"GODFATHER is beyond a being called a movie. It is a subject in philosophy which must be studied by men who want to attain great heights." - Hisgrace

When I first saw GODFATHER, I couldn't stop seeing it for another month. Till date, I still watch it at least once a month so I could relate my affairs for the month with it. Like a mentor speaking, the words of Don Corleone flows through my head. Every move by Michael (AL Pacino) is mathematical. The logic of the whole movie (Part 1,2 & 3) cant be met by any. I tried comparing the movie 'Last Don' to it (Written by same writer, Mario Puzzo) and I just noticed that GODFATHER has no comparing mates. If anyone could come up with a movie like this again then it would have to be the same movie, GODFATHER.
Thank god i didn't die without watching

I strongly recommend you to watch
There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. The acting is superb. The story all consuming. You wonder, will you ever be able to watch another film without using The Godfather as a bench-mark. You won't be able to help yourself.

I hadn't seen the trilogy until recently. I have now watched it twice in the space of a month. The whole film is gripping. I hated characters, loved others, and felt the very conflict the whole film was about. You wonder what you would do. You search your soul. No one should die without seeing this film.
Such a complex story, beautifully executed and each and every characters done their job remarkably well. Well acted, well directed, well scripted- basically anything good you can say about a movie can relate to The Godfather. What makes this film so great is how it develops such a complex character (Michael). He starts out as a war hero, reluctant to head his father's crime empire. Then his father is attacked and just barely survives causing Michael to kill the two men responsible. He runs away to Sicily and marries a woman who is later killed and Michael goes back to America and take up his fathers position as the don of the Corleone crime family. He ultimately sends assassins to kill all of the dons of the other syndicates, completing his descent to an evil gangster. Let us also not forget the ending. Well actually I could go on and on about the baptism scene and the last 5 minutes, so just watch the clips on YouTube (or watch the entire movie). This is my all time favorite film. The sequel is also one of the greatest films of all time. 5/5 stars.
I like to say that this movie was so fine that the violence and sexual references spoiled it all and the message was so deep. The Godfather is by far one of those movies that adults say even 16 year old kids like me can't watch it because it's very hard for even them to watch. It was rated R originally but they changed it to MA probably they think it's too offensive for viewers to say it's a masterpiece and doesn't deserve to be so highly rated. The Shawshank Redemption in the other hand was a perfect movie with the deepest message known as hope and was surprisingly rated MA in Australia and on the TV rating is Rated M which is more fair enough. The Godfather was just horrible and I really thought that Part 2 would be better but it really isn't and for once in my life I'm going to confirm that The Godfather shouldn't deserve to be known as a masterpiece
The Lebron of movies, (2nd only to MJ - Godfather Part II) the original Godfather still holds up, excelling in every area of film making. The support cast is A grade across the board, particularly Duvall and Caan. Brando created an icon, while Coppolla managed to assemble all the pieces to create a masterpiece. But it is Pacino who delivers the performance of a lifetime, only to better it two years later. The Sollozzo scene in the restaurant is an acting masterclass. 10/10.
I find this movie compelling and though crime is present in it, you can feel it is not an obscene ... scene. because it is art. i lked Duvall and Brando more. I like it lets us be smart and ,,see,, the traitors. the senes from Italy are amazing.
Separating the "Godfather", each of the small clips is actually bland, but when these bland clips are combined, they produce such a huge magic, the essence, because all this Real emotions are the foundation, without any contrition, without any exaggeration. Just like our real life, people are actually very sensitive to reality.
This movie is a great honor for all American cinema. Really It's nice an great I've watched this movie 23 times (until now) and I am planing to watch it more. I would like to thank Marlon Brando and Al pacino for this and of course the great director "Copola"
This is the one of the greatest and best crafted gangster films I've ever seen in my life.
The gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, music eases faint sorrow, and conflicts of interest and human nature conflict. No matter it is acting, the use of lens, music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie requires a great deal of downtime, and you can have a new feeling whenever you turn it over and revisit it.
Es they are worth watching. If you like the slow dramas, then the Godfather is for you. There isn't A LOT happening, as in not much action, a lot of talking. But superb acting and an impeccable story.
This movie shines, it's brilliant, it's...beautiful!
i hated it. the movie was so long and it was hard to follow. the sequels were OK. i feel that this movie was over rated way too much. so it had a good year in the seventies but come on how can this boring movie stand for 3 decades i just don't understand how that is possible. Marlon Brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront, A streetcar named desire, and don Juan Marco just to name a few. Pacino wasn't even that good. i much preferred him in Carlitos way and Donnie bras-co and who could forget Scarface. Pacino is getting typecast. i think the only reason he did Simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal. i have to say i can't blame him. Pacino is also getting typecast as a cop i mean insomnia come on
A story about how a good child becomes the boss. Marlon is fascinating
One of the greatest movies ever maid about the organized crime and there leader ship, the movie is a great classic that you have to watch acting directing story is just perfect, one thing to say the 3rd pat wasn't as good as the two before. Best line: "all the power on earth can't change destiny"
This was a classical movie that will left you moved even after watched decades after its making. This is centered on the life of a mafia and his strike with few conflicting families. The reluctant son of the mafia is forced to join the the group due to unprecedented circumstances. Direction, screenplay and acting are in sync.



This film is in the top 10 movies of most of my friends. I can see why: it's a very good movie BUT... I higgly dislike the main side effect of this movie and how many people seem to suffer from it: romanticising the mafia, making heroes out of the worst people on the planet. If you think the public is sophisticated enough to see through this and grasp the real message of the film: mafia = evil, Don Corleone is less evil than the others but is still evil, than guess again.

The Godfather is a great movie and, in a series of three, the quality didn't diminish. The second installment won the Oscar for best picture, and it deserved it. However for those who read the book first, it is all familiar territory. Marlon Brando has only been better in "On the Waterfront" and Al Pacino has never been better, that is saying something. The film is perfect, almost. The book is better than the film and rarely get's mentioned. Emotion is there, but an age old stereotype get's enforced along the way. Everything else is perfect and earns the honour of being a true classic. The problem with the first installment, the second one was somehow better.




1. Usually I ignore movies which have length of more than 1.5-2 Hours.

2. But this movie made me realize the importance of movie length.

3. From there on I never miss such movie length 4. Must Watch Title 5. It has all you need.
All time's great!!!! This movie is beyond everything 1972 the golden era of world cinema.

It,s amazing that Marlon Brando could play an Italian gangster so great even if his wasen,t italianamerican.I think it,s sad that Al pacino never got an Oscar for his performance in this movie and not even in the second godfather movie because i think its Al,s great thing in his career.The movie is one of the few movies which has succeed with a great continue but has unlucky failed with the third.The movie has a great story and is a major work of the director Francis Ford Coppola.It is long and got a several actors who breakthrough with the movie and could do more great performances for example Al Pacino and Robert Duvall.Thank you very much Mr Francis Ford Coppola.
Just watch it, if you haven't already. Or watch it again because this movie is the gift that keeps on giving.

How on the earth is this trash movie 9.3 rated? One of the worst movies I have ever watched, really.
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in my opinion one of the best American film ever made and The greatest gangster film ever made. The Godfather is worldwide avowed as one of the greatest films in world cinema.

The film is about the importance of Mafia family life, the relationship between a father and his sons, power, loyalty, envy, corruption and succession all underscored by composer Nino Rota's iconic music.

The Film makes Deep impression onlooker, you're Watching a movie and you are indebted to the mafia life.

Great Movie, Great Cast, Great Director, Great Coposer...!!!
After watching the entire film of "The Godfather 1", I felt that it was exquisite, exciting, and inexhaustible, showing the exquisite skill of the film master, and the three-dimensional image created by each character, making this movie worthy of being called "man "The Bible", the charm of the godfather 's character, what 's different is that all the benefits are exchanged and the family is right. The family view and the friendship with friends are deep, so that you can re-view yourself from your own world view. A far-reaching romantic gangster epic movie

Another piece of purest cured ham from the Porkfather. Brando is probably history's most overrated artist in any field.

"Mzumble grzblble grnf argle graarg" (falls over with long, loud fart and begins to eat bits of old cheeseburger)

"Yes thank you Marlon, but I'm note sure Shakespeare put the emphasis on the second syllable."


The Godfather is one of the best movies ever. It has an excellent story with an excellent mafia atmosphere, and since I love the mafia theme, I fell in love with this film. It's unbelievable how well the film is made, and it's a 1972 film. The actor Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone, performed a perfect job, and the godfather himself is definitely worth mentioning. Overall, all the actors did an excellent performance here. There are a lot of legendary scenes. The scene in Italy is one of the best and maybe the best scene of all the movies ever. There is also a soundtrack, which is masterful and it is one of the best soundtracks ever. Also maybe the best ever. The Godfather is MASTERPIECE and it's a MUST-SEE movie.
I am a 14 year old film buff and have just set up my account on IMDb if i had set this up earlier i would have commented on this film before now. I watched the Godfather when i got it as a Christmas present 3 years ago, when i watched it i immediately thought wow what a let down!! everyone who i spoke to had said it was one of the best films they had ever seen. But i disagree, there is no denying that the acting and direction in the Godfather is sublime but it is the fact that it is so monotonous, many people will say that it is because i am 14 but i have seen many films including other Coppela films such as The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, which is my favourite film so i definitely am not saying that Coppela cannot direct but what i am saying is that he could have done so much better with the script, the talent and the locations. So overall I am saying this: The Godfather is not a Bad film just very poor and it is definitely not all it is cracked up to be. Thankyou for reading my review.
This film hits all the marks without resulting to cheap gore and over the top performances. One really does feel as if they are a part of the Corleone family. Coppola managed to take a concept as dark and dangerous as the mob and humanize it, creating a full-circle story that makes the viewer feel pain, joy, familial bonds, anger, justice and injustice, throughout. Paired with his incredible storytelling are the performances of everyone in the cast; so strong and believable. (Marlon Brando being my favorite) This film should be a part of everyone's repertoire. What more could I say about a film that has been glorified since its creation?
It is hard to explain how great a great movie with Great Actors along with excellent story and direction.

Godfather belongs to that type of movies which in any generation it is new and will be new and in one world it is forever is best film ever. Francis Ford Coppola successfully could shows mafia world to world in one movie!

Godfather was a signature on Marlon Brando's career and an approval signature on Al Pacino's career.

I am sure any one enjoys of watching this really great movie. Thank you so much Francis Ford Coppola Thank you... thank you. Any way I give 10/10 stars for this excellent movie so do not hesitate to watch it.
One of the best movies i have ever seen

The theme is very gangster. most movies this year dont even match up
If they ask me which films will remain excellent forever, one of the first in this category will be «Godfather». To the word, it is the color and storyline basis of «Godfather» has won recognition of many critics and lovers of similar cinema. The background, excluding Sicilian landscapes and grape fields, is less dynamic, giving preference to acting. The risk was high, as the producers of the film had long been unable to understand the situation inside the work, taking away Coppola's directorial powers, and removing Brando from the main role. And what is most gratifying is that the end result has already been recognized as a classic, and the leading performers will remain in the annals of history for a long time to come. Everyone must see this masterpiece! 10 out of 10
This is perhaps my favorite film of all time. No other picture of its kind is even comparable. It's such a great film that I almost find it difficult to write about. From the cast to the cinematography to the music, this movie leaves you absolutely mesmerized throughout.

The Godfather is not just another "Mob" picture, it is a portrayal of family, life, love & loss. It has just the right elements to captivate any audience. I was probably 12 or 13 years old the first time I viewed this film, and I never grow tired of watching it. The cast really, really made this picture. This movie has perhaps the best cast of characters and acting of any film ever made.

I would love to review each character individually, but I can't. The entire cast no matter how large or small the part, is amazing. This movie is both a classic, and has aged well in the process. I would recommend this film to everyone, no matter what your movie genera preference is.
The Godfather is one of the two or three best movies ever made, A skillfully crafted movie that looks into the heart of a mob family. Micheal is a war hero wanting to stay out of the family business untill his father is shot, After that all bets are off, Al Pacino gives a calm yet chilling preformance as Mike. Well written the movie zips along with no dull parts. 10 out of 10
The Godfather is an engaging and compelling story to say the least, but as a movie- so what? Just because something makes for a great story or play doesn't mean it can automatically translate onto the big screen. There has to be some point of making it into a movie, and quite frankly, The Godfather works just as effectively as a book. The characters, the dialogue, the plot twists- yeah, they're all okay, but where are the shots, the angles, the editing techniques, the sound effects that make this into a number one film??? The conventions of film are all used pretty simply according to the Hollywood format- ie, make the camera invisible. There are few scenes anywhere in The Godfather Trilogy that stand out in the history of cinema. If you want an entertaining movie, you will certainly like the Godfather. But you may just as well read the book (unless, like so many today, you haven't the time). But if you want a film that stretches the genre or that will blow you away with an element OTHER than storyline and dialogue, you can do a lot better.
This movie really is at or near "perfect" level filmmaking. The writing, directing and especially acting are all superb. What a great cast, what a great story (based on a great novel by Puzo)... no matter how many times I watch it, I never get tired of The Godfather.
What can I say that hasn't already been said about the Godfather. It's a masterpiece that is perfect in every way. The casting is perfect, the score is perfect, the story is perfect! It's a perfect movie! This was the first mafia/organized crime film I ever saw. I was 10 and was completely stary eyed when I finished it for the first time. Being from a long line of Italians, the personal mannerism they use in thier day to day life is perfect and authentic. And every actor in this movie acted so so good. If I could I would give an Oscar to every person in this film. If you are not convinced to watch and love the Godfather by all the other reviews I don't know what else I can say to change your mind.
One of cinema's greatest achievements. Trimming the fat of the source novel while keeping the mature spirit, The Godfather is an essential watch for anyone who claims to love movies.
The movie is based on Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and tells a story of an organized crime family that has moved to America to create a fortune and gather the ultimate respect of the surrounding world.

Francis Ford Coppola has directed a masterpiece that lives in its own time and can easily be watched as many times as possible without losing its touch. The movie is quite long and has couple of scenes that are at the same time very violent and very beautiful. Cruel murders are committed and the beautiful music that is played in the background creates an enormous mix of color and sound that has very powerful affect on the viewer who will follow the storyline dazed and amazed. The classic horse head scene, the wedding, murder of NY Police Captain, watching a young war hero to become a ruler of cruel gangster syndicate is just must see scenes
The movie tells a romantic gangster epic in a cool and gloomy style. It is one of the greatest gangster movies in the history of film, known as the man's Bible. After 48 years of dramatic changes in the film market, it can still live in everyone's heart. This film not only has made great success in comment, art and box office, but also set a good example for later generations. It is a classic film praised by many people. In this film, the main purpose is not only to tell the story, but also to establish a correct value orientation for the audience.
Watch any other film and tell me it is better... The only legitimate argument is the sequel. The story, the photography, the casting, an artistic statement of the first degree.
Very interesting story, great plot , great script, and amazing actors ! I don't think we could see a perfect movie like this in many years to come Im glad I finally watched it
Behind Schindler's List, this is my second all-time favorite movie. It is so rich in detail, and style, and acting. EVERYTHING that is on the screen has a purpose, and EVERY bit of dialog is important. If not at the moment, then a few frames later. It is without a doubt the best movie in the mob genre. If it wasn't for this movie, movies like Goodfellas, and Casino could NEVER have been made.

One comment on The Godfather Part II. While it is great and most certainly deserved every award it got (including best pic), it is simply not as good as this one.
The film is an all round great.It really starts to shine however about half way through, after that it never looks back and neither can you.From that moment on your eyes are fixed on the screen.Its a must see movie so if you haven't had the honour of seeing it yet then i advise you do so.Probably one of the best gangster films ever to be created.Marlon Brando places himself above the bar with his performance as thee Godfather.You basically can't go wrong with Marlone Brando and Al Pacino in the same film on top form throughout.After watching your'll probably never look at a horses head in the same way though, or fall out with anyone who knows you have a horse.A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!


Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo bring the famed-mafia novel to life. The Godfather is an excellent portrayal of power, betrayal and family. Beautifully written and stunningly executed, the film is a landmark motion picture with stunning performances (Brando, Pacino, Caan) that is still held up to this day as a timeless classic. Spectacular. Every time I see it, it gets better. From its flawless direction, to its exceptional score, to its (near-)flawless script, I have no doubt "The Godfather" is one of the best movies ever made.
The Godfather had many in awe during its prime, and it still does today. One of the greatest organized crime films ever created, let alone one of the greatest movies ever created, it shows that anything goes as a mobster in the Itlian mafia. Al Pacino became world famous for his role as Micheal Corleon, son of Don Vito Corleon (Marlon Brando), as he prepares to take the family business from his father. As an Italian myself, I can greatly appreciate what this film is trying to do... show what life is really like as a mobster, and what they practically do. Forget the mobster movie flops, or the Sopranos, this movie shows it all. And to follow it up with an even greater sequel is incredible. It's a masterpiece, a must-see by far.
I guess i can see why some people like this movie, a boring film will attract boring people, But i am an adventurist, and if it takes more than 3 hours to tell a story, then i dont want to hear it. This movie put me to sleep, and i can honestly say i had a wonderful NAP while this movie took place. The story is slow, not very eventful, just has the sparatic havic scenes like the bad al pacino movie HEAT. Anyways, if you like pacino, fine, be my guest, But this film is far from number 1 in my opinion
When you feel. That's it nothing more. When you feel.
What's there more to say about The Godfather, than has already been seen. Everything about this movies execution is flawless. The acting is superb, the story is meticulous, the production design and sound work are ouutsanding. The pacing is great. And all in all it just comes together perfectly. The Godfather truly is one of the greatest movies ever made. And it reminds you how great movies can be, when they are done with love, passion and heart. ''The Godfather'' is a timeless masterpiece.
I reviewed it two days ago and I just wanna to say it's a famous but sad story.I will watch it again
The growth and death of a man, the rise and fall of a family. Brotherly love, father and son love, rational and emotional love, friendship, men face the sacrifice and responsibility of family, career, love, the opposition and unity of justice and evil, is interpreted in the film. Countless classic lines, many unforgettable plots.It is also a very classic movie so far.
I think this the best movie after shawshank rademption this movie has marlon brando and al pacino and There is nothing left to say!!!
Life is so beautiful. The plot is very good, but there is a saying that I don't like it. It seems to say that men need to think a lot and bear a lot, but children and women don't. With the feeling that it's a little sexist.
This breathtaking masterpiece tells the story of a crime family through it's rich script and dilemmas. The film has you the minute it starts with the profoundly sympathetic character at the start with his monologue about his daughters circumstances. From start to finish it blurs the lines between good and bad, black and white and begs the question of loyalty, family and power. The crime family with so much power and control cannot control their own family and it's affairs, ironic isn't it? Marlon Brando's performance is the epitome of flawless acting and Al Pacino's acting is seamless and sharp. The film does drag in some parts in my opinion but every film has its flaws and cannot be perfect because perfection is subjective. This film took the books version and perfectly puts it onto film, some say and even in my opinion is better than the book itself.
It's an artistic masterpiece. The story is really great, the characters and the cinematography are outstanding. It shows the real situation of the mobs.
I re-watch this movie after almost 2 year. While at first time i watch i feel little bored bcz of its slowly build up story. But when plot move forward it became more interesting. Not only me others my friends also felt same. When i watch today i totally enjoy it. I didn't have any words to describe this masterpiece. Amazing casting brilliant actors specially Al Pacino and Marlo Brando. And i alos gonna rewatch its 2nd and 3rd part .
The Godfather is a good script by Mario Puzo to be cast into a motion picture but its Francis Ford Coppola who really drilled the task. This movie marks a landmark in the history of films.

Just to be short, i must say that such kind of cinematography, execution, acting, and atmosphere is unique in these series that is rare to be found anywhere else. A great story and amazingly huge drama sets off the viewer out of his movie making knowledge and put him into a different world of gangsters and revenge but still there is something that shines for comfort in their families.

So well this is called a film.......but i hope such great films instead of showing what they showed, should show others love and life. I am saying this just because there is a huge amount of potential in such movies to do what they want to do.
Great scenario, perfect fiction, very good acting... A complete masterpiece...
The Godfather is an absolutely fantastic movie. There is nothing I can say that is negative about this masterpiece. The acting is more than perfect... Al Pacino gives an amazing performance, one of the best in movie history. I can't say anything negative about this movie... It might be perfect... IT IS!!! But if you haven't seen this wonderful part of movie history, you MUST go to the nearest video club AND GET IT!!! I don't think I have added anything to the collection of positive reviews, but THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!

101%... Great, great, great, great, great...

I know how much of an international fetish it is to want to be a gangster, but do we have to endure this dull piece of romanticized wish-fullfillment? Marlon Brando, with cotton stuffed in his mouth, gives yet another ridiculous scenery chewing performance as Don Corleone-the cat sitting in his lap was more interesting. The rest of the cast doesn't fare much better. This is one boring-assed movie. A lot of hand kissing, '40s automobiles, "family values", and the most lazy and repetitive score I've ever heard. This is a classic? Audiences must have been seriously desperate back in 1972.
Considered by many as "the best film in history", 'The Godfather' has earned a prestige and respect over the years, something fully deserved. To speak of 'The Godfather' is to speak of a perfect balance, a masterful balance between an epic Gangsters story, a powerful family drama and a man's personal conflict. All these themes are carried by Coppola in such a fluid way that nothing ends up feeling forced within the story. And although it is true, there are a large number of plots, characters and relationships, the aforementioned fluidity of the narrative, added to a technical perfection to tell the story, causes all these elements to have an impact on the narrative, which is pretty intuitive. Each factor is decisive and influences history, something that every filmmaker aspires to achieve, but that no one can say has achieved as Coppola. It is difficult to define cinematographic perfection, but if this were a conflict that encompasses all its characters and that all the factors play in order to tell the story in the best possible way, then we can consider that 'The Godfather' is a perfect work.

I will tell you an allegory, Godfather is a movie that tells you what a godfather word is and what it means. After people watch godfather movie, it instantly becomes their favourite, and will set their standard of what a real classic and timeless movie is in their future. It will become their trending topic and veneration.

I can't tell you no more, Godfather is a perfect movie. The all three setting components such as place, time, and social environment is perfectly made. The acting skill is flawless. The camera works is precise. The art direction is top notch. If word "masterpiece" could only attached to few movies, then Godfather is definitely one of them.
This story is so realistic. If I analyze why this movie is a classic, the reason is that this is so realistic as a Mafia movie. It caused by the situation that protagonist started as a university student. He was a normal student like us. We felt our self in his place. And then gradually he is changing so we can follow his heart. In that way, we felt that his behavior is kind of inevitable actions. His is required to do it because he is in the position. His killing people is kind of the mission as of port of the society. It make us feeding fearful. This movie's story is so well written. Especially about the realistic situations. We were shocked by that. But greatest movie couldn't be made by only good story. I think movie is a symphony of music pictures and actors. This is indeed one of the greatest symphonies. Well... what a wonderful movie this is!
This whole movie is fantastic. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando and James Caan and Diane Keaton is just *chefs kiss* truly the ideal Mob Movie.
Because of the title of this movies I watched this movie.
MOVIE MAKING AT ITS BEST Excellent in every aspect.... great story, great movie making and very best performances by all the actors. Truly the Best Film Ever. Every actor suited and performed best for his/her part. Marlon was awesome. Story line is very strong and compelling. Cheers to Francis F. C. and Mario Puzo for such a fantastic screenplay. Movie Making is at its best. All 3 movies in the trilogy are good. First Part was the best, second at second place and third at third. Story, making and the acting performances make this movie the best. This movie gave me a whole new perspective to Hollywood and made me realize what Hollywood's magic is. It should be voted number 1. Please vote for this film to make it number 1 of all times. God Bless.

The Godfather is one of those movies, that will take a straight up evil and bad man and make him look human. Francis Ford Coppola, one of the best directors of all time has created what is now considered the greatest motion picture of all time. Although I prefer "Psycho" (1960), "The Dark Knight" (2008) and "The Shawshank Redemption" (1994), there isn't much to argue against The Godfather. It is the pinnacle of flawless storytelling. Seeing how Michael evolves from an innocent young man into the role of the cities biggest Mafia boss, is both gripping and in some ways even fascinating.

The acting, oh boy. Marlon Brando is perfect. Al Pacino is perfect. Everybody else is perfect. What is there to say about The Godfather that has not been said. Great cinematography, perfect editing, perfect acting, perfectly structured, brilliant storytelling and some of the most iconic shots and scenes of all time.

10/10
look i understand how many people love this film; good acting, pretty solid storyline, etc... but one thing that is also a factor is what generation of movie audiences it is geared toward. i am a teenager, and while i do love guns, killing, and all that good "teenage stuff" that is in this movie, many people of my generation do not take such interest in mafia thrillers. i feel that they are a thing of the past, and therefor i do not identify with this movie in the slightest, and basically, don't love it as much as many people seem to. Having said this, i actually liked goodfellas more then the godfather, not because of the mafia ties, but the struggles that the man character underwent; struggles that i can identify with. this was something "The Godfather" lacked.

again, its not bad... its just... OK
I absolutely appreciate all the artists of this movie, And character of Michael is superb.
It's true, this is still a masterpiece! But you didn't need me to tell you that.
A film about post war US life. Maybe I was tired while watching it but anyway I was disappointed. Nothing more than gangster movie at all. Marlon Brando is excellent though... I`m not going to say that it`s chicken-feed but from my point view it has artificially created reputation. La Piovra - italian tv-series is much better in every point.

This movie was fantastic. I see why people call GodFather one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of those movies that just feel so real. I see a lot of other mafia films trying to use this kinda of style but GodFather is on another level. I applaud👋👋
The best movie of all time. Unforgettable catch phrases. Unforgettable role playing. Simply unforgettable. Marlon Brando is the all-time greatest godfather who ever was. Al Pacino's first big hit movie is a triumph. I loved the movie because of decision making and full of frustration and suspense. Excellent.
One of the greatest films of all time the cast the writing the score everything in it and about it is masterful
The greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. Unbelievable acting by all actors specially by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Brilliant script, story and the plot. This movie is perfect from every spot. You can't find a single flaw in the whole film. This film will be remembered for centuries and is gonna take some effort to beat even after all these years!

One of the best movie of all time! Everyone should watch this movie.
Well, When first time I watched The movie it was not so cool to me I mean not so well, I don't know my mind try to say go and watch that again well I watched again but this time 'not bad',Again third time my mind say go and watch again,Third time when I watched, It Was Masterpiece for AllTime!


WOW! As I am yet to see any of the other Godfather movies, this is the best mafia drama I have ever seen and is definitely a top 10 film! The acting in this is outstanding, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan specific. The plot in this movie is the best plot I have ever seen and it is paced so well! The ending is amazing too, what you want to happen, happens. This movie is a cinematographic masterpiece.
The Suicide Squad is a huge step for the DCEU! It is a little overrated at the moment, but is definitely still good. One of my favorite parts is how many characters there are and how they look at their pasts. The cinematography is amazing, James Gunn killed it. The acting is pretty good, I just don't like John Cena. It does have some pretty funny bits to surprisingly. But the starfish, come on that is just stupid.
Film isn't bad, but there are film much better with less ratings. There's no way this is a 9.2. Goodfellas was way better than this.
No doubt a good movie, but to place it among the top ten is foolish. It hasn't introduced anything new at any cinematic level. Its influence on the living trends of cinema is practically zero (no interesting movie made after The Godfather owes anything to it). It's the paradigmatic example of what Fredric Jameson calls nostalgia cinema, a pastiche of the old conventions of gangster movies, a kind of funerary monument. Classical cinema ended long time ago (probably in the fifties), and this movie is just a well-done late survivor, a kind of aesthetic dinosaur.
The gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, the music is soothing and sad, and the interests of the game are conflicting human nature. Whether it is acting or the use of lenses and music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie is extremely necessary to sink your heart to taste carefully, and you can have a new feeling whenever you come back and revisit.
Wow, this is a great film. Repeated (and I do mean repeated) viewings have not changed its power to fascinate and enthrall after all these years. Like the great Greek tragedies, Godfathers I and II just speak the essential truth about humanity and familial relationships in a way that everyone can relate to and can use to understand their own lives. Great art has the power to do that. All of the elements - screenplay, cinematography, acting, music - come together just about perfectly. Perhaps it is because of an accident of time and place and circumstance, like Casablanca, but it is hard to imagine this film being done any other way, or being remade by anyone else, with another cast. Truly one of the essential movies in the cinematic canon.
The movie is a masterpiece, even in 2021 it still is great. It's the best movie of it's kind that I've ever watched.
The 3 movies represent over 9 hours of celebrating a mass murderer and a corporate criminal who is too street-smart always gets away with it.

Good actors, excellent director, but the script is abominable.
I think if you want to learn story board of drama movie you must see this film.and break down the shots - its awesome movie for watching - the lighting is weak.
Al Pacino has played many great characters in motion pictures, including Serpico, Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Bobby Deerfield, Tony Montana, Frank Slade, Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian, Phil Spector, Joe Paterno, and Jimmy Hoffa. The role for which he will be remembered is Michael Corleone. Pacino carries the entire trilogy, surfacing as the main protagonist in the first film opposite Marlon Brando. Brando got people into the theaters, but Pacino was the reason they kept coming back. Regarded as one of the best films in cinematic history, The Godfather is a classic story about the struggle of immigrants to America and the means one family pursues in order to rise from poverty. In addition to Pacino and Brando, John Cazale delivers an outstanding performance.
It is probably 7 or 8 years since I last saw this film but some films you never forget and this is a one of them. The subject matter is effectively an American family and the people who associate with them. Of course very few families are like the one that this film portrays. This film has a running time of nearly three hours and I have never met anyone who has had a negative comment to say about it. Anybody watching The Godfather for the first time may well have heard a certain amount of hype about it and in the case of this film the positive hype is all fully deserved. Like all great films you can look at it and say to yourself how could this film have been improved and in my opinion it could not have been improved. I had read the book first but this film brought the book to life in spectacular fashion. I have never been particularly interested in the numerous different elements in a film or all the politics surrounding it, I am more interested in the whole and this film does not disappoint on any level. Please watch this film at least once before you die you will not be disappointed.
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
This is second highest rated movie of all the time. I had a lot expectations but its not upto the mark. First half of the movie is not that interesting. I am sorry if this makes an offense to the fans. In second half, when Mike takes over, things get interesting but story ends suddenly. Hopefully, for the next part of the movie.

Current days, other Don movies like El Chapo are more interesting and thrilling as compared. I have rated it provided the time of its release and for the story.

I have only heard about the book or maybe the books because i don't read and that is my bad habit so when i knew that there is a movie on "The Godfather" and it is so top rated so i decided to watch it and it was fabulous. This movie was worth watching and i am watching it so late but i don't care. Anyway, the movie was great, i loved it...

Back in 1972 I was much too intellectual to be interested in a movie based on a pulp novel. Then I was dragged to see "The Godfather" and my outlook on popular entertainment changed forever. If "The Godfather" was outstanding, how could "Godfather II" be better? I dunno, but it is. The movies spin a tale of family, and they illustrate how the sins of the fathers, even loving fathers, will cast tragedy across the generations. Steer clear of part III, a redundant tale that begged never to be made.
When I first tried watching this movie, it was 3 AM and I could barely pay attention, and it seemed too long for me to watch. And then I watched Scarface, another very long Pacino movie, and I loved it. That movie helped me get used to long movies, and Pacino movies (it made me a huge fan of Pacino) so I tried The Godfather again, this time renting the newer THX Remastered version (which has great Stereo Sound, by the way) and I watched the whole thing, paying attention all the way through, and I loved it. The key to surviving parts of movies that aren't "action-packed" is to pay attention to the background. Soak it all up, the area, the surroundings, sometimes beautiful scenery (in which there is alot of in another great long movie, The Deer Hunter) If you haven't seen this movie, you should, don't be distracted by the "hype" the movie recieved which might make you think that's all it is, because all of the hype and spoofs it recieved were due to the magnificence of the film.
What makes this movie so great is that the characters seem to leap off the screen, often after only a few minutes. I've never quite figured it out, but it's as if you already know these guys, their habits, their mannerisms, their strengths and faults. Like Clemenza, a guy you hate to love - he'd just as easily kill you as he would pick a weed off his lawn, yet you can't help but respect him. Respect him? What am I saying? But that's the ticket with this movie, Clemenza, Pauli, Tom, Santino, Sal ... these people are so real, it's scary. Oddly enough, the only person who seems an ill fit is Michael, at the start that is. How can anyone so clean cut be related? But Pacino makes it work (unbelievable acting) and nothing is more engaging that watching the 'transformation' he goes through as he becomes the Don.

A bad movie, just lots of conversation for 3 hours, and little action.
"The Godfather" is one of those movies that everyone has heard of, everyone knows scenes of, and is quoted, parodied, and paralleled in everything from major movies to children's cartoons. There's the raspy voice of Don Corleone, the bloody horse's head in bed, and the actors for which the film defined their careers (Robert Duvall, Al Pacino that make this film). All of these things make this film a unique addition to American cinema and a classic to remember for years. The plot follows the trail of the Corleone family for several years after the assassination attempt of the family patriarch, Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). After the Don is unsuccessfully gunned down by five shots from rival's gang, his son Michael (Al Pacino) is forced to take over through a series of unfortunate events. One of the beautifully tragic events in this movie is Michael's transition from naive to a mob leader in his father's name. This movie has it all-action, drama, love, beauty, and politics. It is a must-see of American Film and a institution for mafia films and will be for years to come.
I watched this film when I was a kid, then as a teenager, then twice as an adult. I watch a lot of classic films, foreign and domestic (US), and I am very open minded in my movie selection. Apart from the music score and somber and tragic mood in the film, I find tp be it very unappealing. The cinematography is wonderful, no doubt, but the story telling, script, and acting as mediocre. Marlon Brando's acting has always been overrated, I always heard Marlon Brando, this, Marlon Brando that, I saw 5 of his films and I never watched others. HE's got to be one of the worst actors that ever set foot on a set. Al Pacino acts like he is running on a 2 volt battery in this movie, and they're supposed to be Italians right? Mafia or otherwise Italians do not behave as they do in this movie, and this causes the film to lose credibility. Al Pacino is an amazing actor, my favorite, but in this movie he is mediocre. The Godfather is a great story but the film fails to glue me to the TV. Huge cast, wonderful music and cinematography, what a waste of talent.



I loved this movie. I always used to think it was over-hyped but i finally watched the entire movie in whole not too long ago and i totally see why everyone has been raving about it for years. I also watched other mafia movies such as Scarface, Goodfellas, and Casino and none of them even compared to the great godfather. I honestly cannot say who does better in this movie Brando's character is one for the ages, Pacino is so convincing it gives me chills, Cahn's character is played so well you cant even explain why you like the guy so much, and Duvall is magnificent as the cool under fire lawyer. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out...i know i was.
One of the best movies in history. The level of attachment to the characters is unique and like no other movie
The film tells the story of how Michael, the youngest son of Godfather Don Corleone, became the new godfather, and portrays the fictional New York Mafia in the novel as a family struggle to realize the American dream. This film has been upgraded from a police and bandit story to an epic about the pursuit of rights and the use of power, officially opening the era of "New Hollywood" of Oscar, and expanding the types of gangster crime films, which has a far-reaching impact on many classic gangster films.
A very good movie, a must-see! its very interesting
This movie is a complete masterpiece followed by amazing actors that did a very well job.
The only movie I have ever marked as a 10. Masterpiece! The actors, the acting, the storyline, everything combined made Godfather one of the best movie in the cinematographic history.
Am I seemingly in a very small minority that find gangster films so soo sooo very dull. I concede that The Godfather is the most famous of this genre but as for it forever topping film polls I'm not so sure. And when I say not sure I mean Definitely not! I also admit that I'm not a Brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldn't matter if I like Brando or not, I should still like the film right?, and I just don't. My dad is the biggest Brando fan and even he doesn't reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon. In my opinion Carlito's Way or The Untouchables are far superior 'films'of the genre. I think the main problem I have with The Godfather other then the never ending dullness of it, is that it always seems to be saying 'oh look isn't cool to be in the mob, we should all do it'. Of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met, rather then being the message of the film. Not my cup of tea at all I'm afraid.
Probably one of the most masculine films ever made, at times perhaps dull for today's standards but an absolute masterpiece nonetheless. Brilliant acting coupled with sentimental cinematography and directing, as well as probably one of the most iconic soundtracks in film history.

Mario Puzo's "The Godfather" is an excellent, epic story in the life of an organized crime family. Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone, the head of the family, with such brilliance that we forget "it is Brando who is portraying Vito!" As the film progresses, Vito is critically wounded in a mob hit. Eventually, his son, Michael (Al Pacino), assumes control of the family business. The movie is so authentic in how it relates to the mafia that we, as the viewer, feel as if we are eavesdropping into the lives of a "real" mob family. The film made stars of Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan. Francis Coppola directs magnificently and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece.
From it's stellar opening wedding scene to it's bittersweet conclusion, The Godfather is a groundbreaking and brilliantly made film that deals with themes of power, corruption and family with subtly and finesse. Easily one of the greatest movies ever made.

The plot of the movie is relatively smooth, a story of a gangster fighting, and how the old godfather abdicated and how actor became a new godfather. Although the story is normal, the development is reasonable and smooth. When mentioning the plot, mention Nolan's Inception. His success is because of his plot, the plot is ups and downs, and the brain is a masterpiece. Compared to the story of Inception, the story of The GoIncepti is more real and closer to life. In the actor's acting skills, Marlon Brando explained the old godfather's insurmountability, deep eyes, deep voice, and elegant movements. Undoubtedly a textbook-like performance.
One realizes the importance of movies after watching this movie.Though paced slow , yet misses nothing. The movie tells the story not just of a mafioso but also of one of the strongest and most stable characters created -The GODFATHER. One of the most remarkable part of the movie is Al Pacino's acting. In the beginning he is a very cute person and you don't see any vice in him.Now, when things go bad for him ,you see him changing ,his eyes becoming dangerous.By the end of the movie he is entirely somebody else -The next GODFATHER. The theme music has a touch of negativity in it to depict the dark side of the Godfather but the Sicilian part has very soothing music also. The only drawback(if at all it is) is the pace of the movie which might seem slow compared to these days movie with so many cuts and pacing music,but if you have the patience to watch it, only then will you realize how great the movie is.
I can't understand how people can enjoy this movie when it's so slow and still. I couldn't even stand the first 20 minutes. The atmosphere is all too quiet and it's all just people talking. A lot of people would rate this movie 10/10 and think they're intelligent or something.
this is one of the greatest films ever made. Hands down. If you like movies and have yet to see this film. See it you will not be disappointed. The film has a little something for everyone in it. It follows the book The Godfather by Mario Puzzo. Basically, it is about Don Vito Corelone retiring as head of the family business and handing it to his son Michael. This movie is definitely at the top of my list. It is my favorite of the trilogy with Part 3 in a close second. Every part of this film is perfect. From the acting to the technical aspect. The AFI ranked this movie somewhere in the top five or ten films ever made. In my opinion it should be number one.

Fabulous film 10/10 stars.
"The Godfather" is a gangster capitalist society about the entire U.S. ground force systems dominate the control group the story of ups and downs in the story, is very vivid characterization.

One of the greatest movies ever made. And amazingly, surpassed by the even more expansive and epic "Godfather Part II". Iconic in every sense of the word.



The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's best movie. This movie is a masterpiece. Marlon Brando is good in this and he won an Oscar for his performance. Al Pacino got nominated for an Oscar, James Caan got nominated for an Oscar and Robert Duvall got nominated for an Oscar. I liked the sets, the acting, the script, and the cinematography. This movie is better than Apocalypse Now. I think Francis Ford Coppola should have won an Oscar for Best Director. Least he won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay with Mario Puzo. I own the book The Godfather by Mario Puzo and I read some of it and it is good. This movie is one of the best movies ever made well maybe the exception of Pulp Fiction.

A legendary film, great performance and storytelling. Marlon Brando acts like a genuine mafia boss that walked on set. Music score really makes the emotions of the film better.
The Godfather is one of the most famous movies ever made. People can quote the lines, they know the theme song. It's a perfect movie. The story is based on Mario Puzo's terrific novel and the cast is wonderful led by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. A true classic.

This is just a great movie. There is not one bad thing I could say about it. It's because of movies like this that I'm so passionate about movies. If you haven't seen The Godfather as well as Parts II & III you're missing out on something special.
One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
Many reviews talk about the genius evidenced in this masterpiece of "gangster" movies. Of course, it really is a family movie, with a story set in the gangster world. What can I add that has not been said already? The simple fact that this classic captures the family dynamic that is practically gone from movies of the last 20 years.

The movie does not drown in schmaltz or sappy emotion. The love of the sons for the Godfather is natural and understandable. We can all identify with loving someone so much that we would be willing to die for them, or worse. The togetherness as well as the personal prejudices of the Corleone family (esp. Sonny) make the dynamic totally believable.

I loved this movie, and I can watch it over and over. In fact, I think I will!
This is the definitive film! One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece.
This movie had me speechless by the end. In this movies there are no errors,no mistakes, everything is perfection. It is perfect in every aspect of the movie. It boosted Pacino to stardom along with a Dog Day Afternoon. It is Francis Ford Copollas greatest classic alongside Apocalypse now. This movie has a great story line and shows what its really like to be in a mob family down to the very last detail. No part of this movie is wrong and the views of the mob are correctly viewed. This movie is an all-time classic. I would not consider it the greatest mobster movie as i feel Good Fellas is but it is perfect and could not have been done better by a perfect director. I give this movie an amazing 10 out of 10.
It's remarkable how a film 30 years old can still amaze even teens (I'm 17, you know). It has an incredible script and its filming is just perfect. It doesn't have any flaw, and probably the best highlight is its cast with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. etc. etc., all of them shine thru the movie and make this (too) long film most enjoyable despite the extreme length. With two worth viewing sequels (specially Godfather II with the majestic Robert De Niro), The Godfather is best saga in history of movies, much, but much more than Star Wars. The one and only classic in movie history, the best of all times that can never be beaten.
Coppola's immortal cinematic masterpiece in the history of cinema, the greatest cinematic film, has an impact in the world of films. The greatest director in the history of cinema and the greatest acting. Marlon Brando, the godfather of world cinema, has played a great role in the history of cinema 10/10.
This film acurately depicted scenes from the book very well, and the acting is good. That said, not all books cross to film well. This is one such instance, in my opinion. Beyond the faithful recreations of some classic scenes, I don't see what there is to like. I'm sure some people say they just like it because it's popular.
The perfect gangstser movie, so original and creative, great acting great dialogues, never boring. 10/10

Just a pure masterclass of film making, the quran , bible and the gita of film making, it was my second time watching, this is the film which was inspired my many ✨🔥🔥🔥 i ll just note down the movies which inspired many directors atleast to take a scene from this plot they were vadachennai, nayagan, Chekka chivandha vaanam, pudhupettai and all these were a cult classic in tamil industry which was inspired this masterpiece , u will see how bigger and cult will be of this film 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 a tru true cult classic so honest and intense in screenplay and the story oh boy we will be living in it , the don corleone family will be in front every frame just a pure magic this director did it all right 🔥🔥 brando oh boy his acting sure won him an oscar and Al pacino and all the crews just nailed every scene of it ✨🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pls doo watch available in prime , this was my 2nd time and i reccommend you to do soo as well🔥🔥🔥✨✨⭐its been 50 years but the movie is as gold as new 🔥✨

the godfather does what it does at it's finest, memorable moments,characters and situations. all the actors made the best they could and more, interesting plot and mix it with some drama-crime you have a master piece, glorious and epic in mafia movies and one of the best if not the best movie ever made, Francis ford made the best crime drama movie till date and alpacino made the godfather even better with his acting and role, the moment that stick's out is ¨"ill make him an offer he can't refuse" it is just a small line but epic if you understand it and know what could happen because he is the godfather and he is the mafia leader and he does a fine job at doing so. 10/10 godfather approves

This movie is a masterpiece. They should have left it alone. Everyone talks bad about the 3rd; but the 2nd was to the 1st, what the 3rd was to the 2nd.
It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great.It's excellent in arts - design, cinematography, editing, and music.
Godfather needs no introduction as the name says it all. This movie in fact is godfather to all film makers and movie lovers. Right from the opening scene to the last scene, every scene is perfectly craved to make the movie the most perfect movie of all time and it well deserves all the awards it has got. I found Godfather very boring when I watched it first time as i was little and naive and needed more over do of everything in movies i watch. I watched it again some years later and i found it likable and hence with every re-watching i fell more in love with film and i started to notice the genius in it. The acting, the script, the music, the characters, the story, the screenplay, costumes, art, direction everything is just near perfect. Anyone who lived after 1972 has no chance of missing this magnum opus. We will be eternally grateful to Coppola for this masterpiece. A brave 10 on 10.
Like Citizen Kane, the Godfather is extremely influential, but more than a bit overrated. Coppola has essentially one trick - intercuttung violence with religious ceremonies. In the first two Godfather films this is an extremely effective device. Unfortunately, some of the other parts of this film are not quite as well thought out. The scenes of Michael in Italy are too long and underdeveloped. Appolonia falls for Michael in a way that only happens in the movies so the audience has very little emotional investment in her or her death. Most people would say I'm nitpicking, but to be honest there are more than a few films that I have enjoyed more than the Godfather.

Having said that, this cast (Fred Roos is the greatest casting director ever) and crew might be the best group of talent ever assembled for one film. They went on to make some of the greatest films of their generation both in front of, and behind the camera. If you don't believe me, just check their individual credits.
This epic movie, huge story structure, complicated character relationships, and many plot points all need to be established in the first act to lay a solid foundation for the subsequent narrative; pursue unlimited in this limited time Space, I think that as long as you can put all the relevant content into it without being bloated, it is already quite a realm; you can also comb in a paragraph in a clear and concise manner, which can only be done by the master's generous efforts.
Nearly 50 years later, Godfather is still a movie that audience are interested in. The legendary story background, vivid characters, power struggle between gangs, light, music and lines are all first-class. In video game Mafia, the leading role is also calling Vito. Maybe it's a tribute to Godfather.
I said geod father how funny I'm? But let's be honest amazing job
Francis Coppola's crime masterpiece could be the story of any family without the Murder and Bloodshed. It shows audiences what it is like to kill, as well as why someone might do it. Everyone should watch this movie at some point in their lives.
Best Movie Ever. Since the first time i saw it, i did not expect how this film would grow on me, now everytime it's on tv or somewhere else i need to watch it again. I never get tired of it.
Simply brilliant, it tells the sad truth that circulates in some places. This film shows how the mafia works in all its brutality, for a 1977 film it is still a current story. The soundtrack is unforgettable, well composed and goosebumps, the plot is engaging and full of twists, truly a masterpiece. I'll be watching Part 2 and Part 3 shortly and can't wait.
The movie everyone has to say they liked (don't dare to say you never watched it) if they don't to go in a fight with a stranger.
Especially for his first film which won a myriad of awards such as best film at the Academy Award and Golden Globe in 1973, and Marlon Brando who won best actor thanks to his acting as the Godfather.
This movie is MORE deserving of the spot held by Shawshank on this site as the best movie of all time. The film was rather concise, leaving the viewer with a desire for more. The main character, bizarre voice aside, was a character that is easy to get attached too, both in part to the well written script, and on point acting. A classic movie everyone should see. I am glad to have a movie in the top 5 that is an example of nearly unanimous support.
One of the best films ever, The Godfather is such a great gangster drama and representation of cinema.
What can you say? Coppola got every bit of realism and ability out of the whole cast. They turned themselves inside out. This 3 part saga is definitely in the top 20.

Awsome very amazing story i love it Awsome very amazing story i love it Awsome very amazing story i love it Awsome very amazing story i love it
If you want to see the quintessential american crime film? Goodfellas. The Godfather is romanticized garbage in comparison. Take a look at Coppolas' interviews about the godfather. It is not a film he was passionate about doing, nor is he proud of the mafia legacy and he was a little bit insulted the studio thought he would do a good job just because he was Italian. Coppola purposely turned the story into a universal tale of a king and his family to avoid the broken, bloody and undressed view of the "earners" on the street. He didnt want to focus on this, because of his aforementioned lack of pride. He turned the mafia into a fairy-tale.

Scorcese created goodfellas with passion and respect. The line between good and evil was blurred, as it is in real life. The good stories of the mafia dont come from the "Don". They come from the "earners". The guys in the trenches. They are what keeps the wheel turning.
I think the movie was okay, but could have accomplished much more. I, personally, believe that the movie was way too long. There were a number of scenes and shots which served no purpose to the actual story line that could have been edited out and which made parts of it slow and dull. I realize that most of these were made for benefit of the director's artistic vision, but art doesn't always make for good story telling -- just look at 2001.
The Godfather is excellent Melo drama of crime film. About family, social, personal of our self about what should we do for protect the family and bring a punishment for bad people, and we also must teach a bad people with kindness not with violence.
The best movies of all time💯 That you can Never forget
The first thing i have to say is that it's way too long and you can barely get through it, part of this is because there are too many extended scenes in it. Granted it's a good movie, but not by any chance the best movie ever made and not better than The Shawshank Redemption (i'm comparing it to Shawshank because they are the 2 leading movies in the IMDb top). The acting is great, the script is good and the directing is OK, but that doesn't make it the best movie ever made. There's almost no foreshadowing in it, there are no major twists in the plot thus making the storyline actually a straight line and there's nothing in the movie that surprises you. When i watched it i was at the edge of boredom and was hoping something would show up in that movie that would pull me back. It's true that it was a very daring movie at the time, but still that alone doesn't make a movie great.
The Godfather is the best top rated movie of all times. With the young Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall. Topped with the Great Marlon Brando. A great cast. The plot or storyline was way beyond enjoyable.
The Italian church and the representative of the underworld of the successful people in the United States and other capitalist countries in the world of escape, adventure, foothold, revenge, whitewash growth history, mixed knead knead the family, love, friendship in different circumstances under the birth and destruction. Family interests above all, all against the growth and development of the family must be destroyed. The coexistence of interests is the basis of harmony, and the difference of interests is the beginning of hostility. The old godfather dies, the new godfather is born. Is the beginning of the end which cannot be stopped.
When people hear the word "Godfather" they think, "Best movie ever made!!!". Well that is (in my opinion) a bunch of bullcrap!!! Don't get me wrong, The Godfather is an excellent piece of work, but I wouldn't go so far to say it is the best movie ever made. Personally, I like GoodFellas a little better. The Godfather has the best of all the qualities for a movie = great directing, great writing (not as good as the book), excellent acting (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DuVall), and all that jazz, but I still don't think it is the best movie ever made. One of the top 10 movies ever made (most likely), One of the top 5 movies ever made (maybe), the best movie ever made (I don't think so). If you like Mafia movies, this is the one that started them. If you are looking for the best Mafia movie or televison show, watch "The Sopranos" Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. If you haven't seen "The Godfather" yet, I would rent it immediatley! Grade: A


The Godfather is one of those timeless classics that will stand the test of time. It was during the time where there were more movies that had a run time of around 3 hours. Movies that run for 3 hours and after watching it makes it seem like half of that time did what they did right. This movie has timeless drama, tragedy, characters, story, revenge, dialogue, and moments that keeps it alive even almost 50 years later. This one should be on every movie buff's watchlist. If you are a Breaking Bad fan, you need to thank this movie because a lot of inspiration for that show came from this movie. There are even moments that are directly taken from the movie that was brought to the show. I don't want to spoil it because that would take the experience out of it. Please watch this and Breaking Bad as well with Better Call Saul.
Tempting to give this less than ten so there's room to take it up a notch for part 2, but would be spuriously ungenerous. Almost cliched with the horses head, "offer he can't refuse" and "sleeps with the fishes". Even now, nearly 50 years on, the period detail for the time it is set seems oddly even more valid


About the only thing I remember when it comes to being introduced to this movie was with my oldest brother bringing in a box of movies that he didn't watch anymore. It turns out that one of them was this flawless work of art that we know as "The Godfather." Often imitated, never duplicated, you cannot go wrong with this. After watching it once, you just have to watch it again. The writing is crisp, the acting is excellent, and the music will hook you in without fail.

"The Godfather" is pretty much a staple with my family, particularly with me and my middle brother. My mom loves it just the same and would recommend it to anyone. As my title states (and as anyone else may say as well), this is truly one of the best movies ever made. Period. You cannot put any other movie against it whatsoever. It won't work. Watch "The Godfather" once and then watch it again. It will give just about every other mafia movie a run for its money...and then some.
This movie is flawless, it has amazing acting, powerful dialogs and great cinematography. I watches this today and I wish I watched it wat earlier
I don't think we will get to see a movie as good and as Iconic as the godfather ever again
The characters are numerous, the story is huge, the structure is flexible, the composition is exquisite. The essence of a movie is the art of telling a story. In a limited time, it is vivid and full to tell a complete story. In a movie, you can see the life of others, and it seems that you have finished your own life.

The plot is not complicated, but it is inadvertently profound. Marlon Brando's performance is impeccable.
This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.
The Godfather, with its superb cast, (Brando, Pacino and James Caan) is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Marlon Brando changes his accent from an American to an Italian, which is so amazing. Pacino is great, especially when potraying Michael, who dreams of going to college when he comes back from the army. His dreams are shattered when he has to take over for his father, while Brando is in a hospital. The storyline unfolds from there, and this movie is definetly a classic.
If you're wondering why I put exclamation points after the headline, it's because I thought this movie was just another overrated pile of junk. Man was I wrong! This movie was quite good. Sure it isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely in my Top 250! This should definitely replace boring THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as #1 in the Top 250. It's about the Corleone family's criminal empire run by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and trying to pass it on to his son Michael (Al Pacino) You shouldn't watch this movie if you are under age 16 though. It's quite violent and no one under that age would understand it anyway. Definitely watch this movie. It is very well done.

8.5/10 or: B

"I'll give him an offer he can't refuse." "Never let your enemies know what you're thinking." "Never hate your enemy. It affects your judgment." Malone's performance was truly disheartening, the inarticulate godfather, but no one dared ignore his every word. His face was always impassive, but behind it lurked something that could not be ignored -- a kind of elegant rage, calm cruelty!
What can I say that hasn't already been said. The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a classic in every sense of the word. Though some may enjoy this film more than others, none can deny its brilliance, and its everlasting appeal as a part of Hollywood legend that divided the industry into sections of old Hollywood (pre-Godfather) and new Hollywood.
the film that made Marlon Brando more famous than ever, the Mob Epic of all Mob Epics starring one of the greatest casts of all time, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton etc. A longer than 3 hour mobster drama that every adult who is worth knowing will have seen, a piece of genius to end all mob genius. I can't praise it enough!

****/****
The film begins slowly and dramatically as a man begs the Godfather to pay "justice" to the men who have beaten his daughter. A Godfather cannot refuse a request on the day of his daghter's wedding.

This film is a film of such purity and nourishment, an absolute classic which I cannot even begin to describe. The music is breathtakingly aweing, as is the acting. Every line and every action has it's purpous that eventialy all comes together, at the end, especialy the last scene, just makes you want to stand up scream for joy and sorrow and pity all at once.

If you see this film you will never forget it. I have bought it and still can't see it enough. 100%. A+. Five Stars.
In my opinion "The Godfather" is the best movie ever made. It is far and away the best conceptualized film from a novel that has been made, even when compared to "Gone with the Wind".
Compared with the requirement for a literary work to have a sense of picture, the film directly presents the picture. Therefore, the movie can be enjoyed by both elegance and vulgarity, because the picture can be seen by everyone, and the rich soundtrack and soundtrack make the movie this art form Exudes infinite charm. But the movie itself has its own art form and creative technique. Reading the movie itself can better experience the charm of movie art.
All I want to say is that : The God Father is always god father.
All I want to say is that:God Father is always god father.
The best movie ever, it's a GREAT movie! Marlon Brando gives a great performance as Don Vito Corleone, so does Al Pacino and Robert Duvall, it is the best drama in history, it is a classic! I absolutely loved the story! A Mafia known as the "Godfather" who hands over his criminal empire to his son, Micheal (Al Pacino) and things go wrong! Brilliant! SO brilliant! It's very long but very good, Francis Ford Coppola, thank you So much for directing this masterpiece back in the 70s, and bringing the best actors: Pacino and Brando, especially Robert Duvall ! I wish that there were more but to-be-fair, if they brought more, the newer movies would probably be like 1% on Rotten Tomatoes! And also, fun fact: Francis Ford Coppola is still alive and 80 years old right now! It's good to hear that, man!
Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest directors of all time,have made many classic movies but i think that it is very difficult to find another movie made by him or by some also great director that can reach the literally unprecedented greatness of this film.This movie is perfect on every aspect:one-of-a-kind direction,superb acting,flawless plot and probably the best soundtrack ever used in a movie.Also the Godfather is a very touching and emotional movie,has a lot to do with the human mourn and the ensuing revenges that never ever end,furthermore it is about human relationships,greed for power,loyalty,devotion and respect.To sum up The Godfather is one of the few and far between true flawless masterpieces of all time and if you want to consider yourself an avid film-watcher,you have to watch it.

That's too good just amazing. I just saw this somedays ago.

America, American, Americans, American italian,american italian don,american italian don of crimes, american italian don of organized crimes with a spectacular screenplay and wonderful portait of characters in 1970's ,I saw that film in 2019 it's mesmerizing.
The rhythm is gentle and the music is light and sad, but it contains great energy. Whether it is performance or the use of lenses and music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment
I don't think it is necessary to say more, because more good film critics are enough to praise this great movie. Forever summer memories, my childhood movie enlightenment.

I will be never satisfied of watching it. everything is perfect in this movie.
The godfather is a wonderful movie, unfortunately I hate this movie

Citizen Kane ? please, it doesn't even compare to The Godfather. Wrongfully placed 3rd on the all time greatest list of movies, The Godfather is perfection personified. In today's high tech and fast paced times, there will never be a movie with such depth, and meaning as the Godfather. Some say it's a story about crime, but in actuality it's a story on loyalty and betrayal in a family. About how generations evolve, and particularly about the metamorphosis of Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone, turned for a straight war hero, to the ruthless leader of the Corleone Family. Coppolla's vision will forever be labelled his diffinitive work. The saga which is the Godfather is the greatest story ever told, the characters are authentic and the story is timeless. I think those critics must reconsider the final verdict and place The Godfather in it's rightful place, at the top of the movie mountain.
The first movie I've ever watched that left me with the feeling that I saw something bigger than just a movie. I remember it really well - I was 16, my parents were abroad and I watched it at home with a couple of good friends. When you remember the time and setting you watched a movie so well, it is because it really touched you and influenced you, and that's what I think that movie did to me. You really should watch it. It is an offer you can't refuse!
Everything that can go right in this movie does. This movie is a timeless classic that everyone should see.
The wedding sequence is a virtuoso stretch of filmmaking Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released

I really don't need to review this movie. All the 10/10's speak for themselves and if you look up best movies ever, this is probably at the top of 99% of the list's. I only consider movies better than the Godfather Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List), but The Godfather is most likely the greatest achievment in cinema history.

10/10 of course.

This movie is one of the most brilliantly crafted piece of film i have ever seen. The story is told so well, so complex, and with so many characters you could get lost but...its so engaging its brilliance. The dirction is in VERY HIGH top notch and so is the acting. The script is great and this is a must see for everyone.
In my opinion, it is the best film in the history of cinema.
What other could I say than "The Best of the Best!"

After big time Mob King Don Vito Corleone is wounded in a mob hit, his son Michael takes action on the people who tried to kill him. After Michael hides away from New York, The Corleone family is falling apart. The favorite son has been killed. And soon, Vito dies of a heart attack. As Michael becomes the new family leader, he kills the other gang leaders. See 'The Godfather Part II' to continue the story and saga....

Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden, Al Lettieri, John Cazale, Gianni Russo, John Marley, and James Caan as Sonny. 4 out of 4.
Heard a lot about this movie but i was not interested in watching this movie since it is a gangster movie and there would not be much of a story but then i watched the trilogy and was by blown away by the performances and the screenplay,this is truly the greatest gangster movie ever made,that is the reason it is still remembered even after 45 years and this has been adapted by various filmmakers
There's no transition between Michael I (american hero, away of family business) and Michael II (Sicilian mobster). The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence.

It is hard to find a flaw with this movie. Coppola directs the movie so superbly that it seems very realistic, almost as if the viewer is eavesdropping into the lives of an actual organized crime family. Brando has the best performance of his career as the leader of the Corleone family. Strong performances by Pacino, Duvall, and Caan. Excellent editing, screenplay, and score. Score: 10+ (out of 10).



Great picture, great cast. Now see the Offer to tell you how they did it! On Paramount +. Good cast and you won't regret paying for a subscription. Godfather set the pace and rules for every other gangster movie since!
The best movie I've have ever seen. Want to more movies like these.

The costumes and scenario and offcourse the actors are really good. The sound of the film are great, Al pacino and Marlo Brando excellent acting andthe oter thing i like are the cars really beatiful.
One of the most perfect movies ever made. In amazes me when people think this is about organized crime,la cosa nostra,or the Mafia.it's not. I think it's one of the most accurate coming-of-age movie I've ever seen, not necessarily for the whole family, but in my own opinion a prerequisite for every American.

In other words it is not the greatest film of all time. I cannot stand people who have claimed it to be. It is no where as a good as Shawshank, Alien and definitely is not, and never will be, as good as Taxi Driver. It does have its moments and Al Pacino was brilliant, (no I'm not going to give Marlon Brando a shout out, because he too is overrated) the music is stunning and so is the story but it isn't very catching I had to space the viewing over a number of days because I couldn't be arsed watching all at once without felling the urge to watch something else. It rises well but then falls flat on to its face then slowly makes it to it's knees towards the end. Yet I still find it hard to believe how it is the 'best' film ever.

A fantastic movie. Its moving and gritty storyline takes you through a wide range of emotions: happy, sad, angry, and fearful, although you can never feel for the characters. (For obvious reasons). I liked the sequel personally better, but not by much. The series should have stopped at #2, because Mario Puzzo's novel spanned the first 2 movies. See it instead of sitting at your computer all day. Now.
This is the worst movie ever. It is so over rated. One of the worst movies ever made. 3 Oscars? are you kidding me? more like 0 Oscars. why do people like this movie so much. i guess all critics and 91 percent of people are dumb. oh well, as i was saying, avoid this film at all costs. Al Pacino and Robert Duvall are the worst actors ever.

and it's so boring. i fell asleep half way through it. then i woke up. it was still going. i fell asleep again. i woke up again and it was still going! i know i already said this, bt the Godfather is the worst movie ever it was so bad that i'm just kidding. it's a classic. it's still over rated. but that's not saying much. 10/10.

The godfather story provides a terrible source of pleasure rooted in the hearts of americans, giving readers a close-up view of a thrilling dark and violent illegal class and a feast for the reader's dangerous lifestyle. Classic mob story!
Mafia people so cool they make me wanna buy italian pizza so great so amazing sheesh.
This movie has been regarded as the best movie of all time, and I watched it for the first time a couple weeks back. I must admit, it is AMAZING AND DESERVES THE LOVE, but it isn't my My Favourite Movie Ever or anything. I don't even think it cracks my Top Ten, but that's not saying it's not a cultural phenomenon.

8.5/10.
No wonder this is considered a classic. The screenplay was excellent, telling a compelling story and eliminating all the unnecessary scenes in the book. The acting was superb. Marlon Brando as the Don was just as powerful and distinguished as I expected him to be. Michael's transformation from college kid who wanted to steer clear of the family business to a godfather in the making was highly convincing. It's a pity that the version I watched lacked subtitles as I don't understand Italian, but I could still follow the plot. I often find that movies don't do justice to the books on which they are based, so it's great to have found one which does the book great credit.
A series of films of the strongest productions of the world cinema wonderful in every sense of the drama in particular
One of the jewels in the crown of the 70s cinema, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. Itialian immigrants, caring people, and mafioso. From the first frame in which you see Marlon Brando's face lit from in front and above like a dark angel to the last frame of the last film in which Al Pacino's wineglass falls out of his hand as he slumps, the family gone and destroyed.

The Godfather is the holy trinity of mob films. Every film after it has its influences in it, and, much like some people look towards the Star Wars trilogy for an answer to every question, many people do so for The Godfather.
I was entertained by the Godfather. A lot. So don't think that this is a negative review.

The godfather has kind of set it self up to be kind of like a joke now. Come on. "Don't forget the canole!" It is kind of stereotypical of Italians, even though Coppola himself was an Italian and didn't intend it to be that way. Marlon Brando is great, but he is still way overrated. Al Pacino, however, is amazing, and made me rethink my earlier opinion that he was an overactor. James Caan of course is great, as is Diane Keaton. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good as Part Two, which is a masterpiece.

Oh, and one more thing... Nino Rota made the best score ever with this one.

7/10 Stars


One of the greatest films ever made! It stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Rober Duvall and James Caan as members of a powerful mob family. Brando is unforgettable and Pacino's transformation from responsible son to menacing thug is eerily effective. Some unforgettable scenes include the shooting in a deli. This is the greatest crime film ever made and stands as a great "male" soap opera. Don't forget about the Godfather Part 2! You'll miss more of the greatness! (The Godfather Part 3 is good, but poor by comparison)
I was deeply impressed by two places in this film, one was cold revenge, and the other was warm affection. I always dreamed that when I was about to age, I could have the supreme right to speak like Godfather Corleone. I also dreamed of having a happy family and having fun.
The best movie in the history of cinema There really is no more unique than this movie in my opinion I have little to say I still enjoy watching this movie and learning something from it.
THE GODFATHER C-170min(1972)****D:Francis Ford Coppola. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte. Francis Ford Coppola's unique crime saga remains one of the most popular and memorable films ever made as a Mafia boss's innocent son gets into the family busisness. A strong American film with moving performances, top-notch direction, and a tightly-plotted Oscar winning script by Coppola and Mario Puzo from his novel along with Nino Rota's tragic score and Gordon Willis's

groundbreaking cinematography makes this a superlative effort. Oscar winner for Best Picture and to Brando's magnetic performances. Followed by two sequels.
After seeing this movie numerous times I have to say that overall I find it highly overrated. It is definately well crafted and the acting is superb. However the pacing is dreadfully slow at times and while I think overall the acting is strong it does get a little overblown at times. Definately one of the best movies in its genre, unfortunately imho its not a genre with many good films.
I did not become a fan of this film until the early 90s when I saw it on video tape. This film is definitely a masterpiece. Its a film I dont get tired of watching. The characters are compelling and the actors are superb. Definitely one of my five favorite films, along with its incredible sequel
People always say America is a big melting pot, but actually it is not actually like that. America is separated by different communities,the WASP, the catholics, Jewish people, the Asian, and the black people.Italian immigrants belong to the catholics,but they are looked down upon by some other European immigrants,so they have to ask help from their godfather, the mafia. This film is really impressive.Don Coleone is really a good father, his elder son has a bad temper, his second son is weak, his younger son is intelligent ans unique.This is a big family,this family culture is deeply rooted in their brains.This film is a mirror of Italy society:Power, Women and Money. There is a lot of media reports about Italy PM ex-PM Belusconi, why this corrupt PM not sacked even he faces lots of charges? People always say America dream, but the reality is cruel. If you want to make fortune, you must have support from your relations even the mafia.The wealth is controlled by a few people, they make their money through their relations become richer.This is Capitalism.
I have seen The Godfather many times over the past twenty years. It started with my brother watching the movie and I watched it when I was seven. The only parts I remembered at the time were the famous scenes (the horse's head, Sonny being setup at the toll booth) which goes to show you that if a movie can put a searing memory in a seven year old critic, imagine what it can do to the same critic twenty years later!

This is without a doubt one of the top 5 best movies of all time, BAR NONE. If anyone disagrees with this, you obviously do not know a genius film when you see one or you don't like excellent storytelling, acting, directing, filming, etc. (and who doesn't). If you enjoy bad movies, don't see this one. Coppola and Puzo do a marvelous job of putting this movie to the silver screen and will be remembered for its greatness for a long, long time.
Plot: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Pacing: 9/10 Music: 10/10.
In Terms of acting in this movie ,this is the highest pinacle for a movie can achieve. Brando, pachino, de niro all are Gods there..i dont know How many times I watch this masterpiece & in future i dont know how many times im gonna watch this. I wish to give 100 stars.




Over the years, I had heard a lot about this movie but, for some reason, had never seen it. About two years ago, I found myself with a free evening and began searching for a movie to watch online. I ran across The Godfather and thought all right, I'll finally get to see this masterpiece!

Although I began watching it with high expectations, they were gone within about 20 minutes. I found it to be boring to the extreme and almost turned it off on several occasions, but I decided to stick with it in the hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it didn't. By the time that it had ended, I was actually mad that I had wasted over two hours of my life watching it.

I realize that I'm in the extreme minority, but I absolutely did not like this movie at all.
I will never talk about anything. just watch it and enjoy the legendary music.and take advises from corleone's father it will be usefull for your life.

Nice one. I recommend must watch. I saw this 1000 time.
The Godfather earns its status as a landmark in cinema. Coppola outdoes himself in his direction, and the performance of Marlon Brando as the titular character may be the most iconic role in film history. Sporting a great story, lots of suspense and a perfect ending, The Godfather is a must see for anybody.
Mafia and gangs wasn't my thing but I decided to watch it for changing, and with all these reviews I expected something will make my head blow. I would say it's not that different from other gangs movies so ..
This film put mafia films out there many parts of it are undeniably perfect acting, cinematography and story-telling.

It introduces us to the cruel world it is where power buys you respect, and it is earned through putting fear into people.

The Godfathers only criticism is it's slowness - and today no films like that could ever be put into production - and it might have to be viewed more seriously then other films but definitely worth the watch. Shout out to Marlon Brando for giving us the best piece of acting in history.
10/10 Yeah, I'll admit it. I worship movies like these. Star Wars, Dr. Strangelove, you name it. Performances: A+ Directing: A Filming: A- Writing: A+ Actors: A+ Everything else: A+

This movie is the best mafia movie ever made, and quite possibly the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando was brilliant as was the rest of the cast. I recently saw Citizen Kane(which is a very good movie) but I would have to say that the Godfather is far superior. Overall 11/10 Absolutely Brillant Film!!!
As a classic film, "The Godfather" is perfect in storytelling, performance, photography, and movie skills, and can be used as a textbook for movies. As an epic film, the whole story has a huge pattern, a complicated plot, and many characters. There are more than 20 characters who need to be expressed, but the film handles them in an orderly manner. Under Coppola's superb director skills, the characters are distinct in primary and secondary, and the character is full. Some characters only need one lens and one detail to express the character's character.
A wise woman does not expose a man's lies. A wise man does not let a woman know she is lying.
Good one and it is very nice as well as interesting. I will recommend it
Just fantastic , especially parts 1 & 2. MUST WATCH if u still did not.
I seem 2 b 1 of the only other people in the whole world who didnt find this film as amazing as the hype makes it out 2 b. It was a good film, i give it that, but i didnt think it was anythin 2 special. It was good for its time, but i just felt that the plot was kinda obvious and i didnt think that the story was the best i have ever heard. Finally, in da end, i just found that i was left kind of disappointed. I feel Goodfellas dominates over this film threefold.

Never can this kind of movie be ever made... Francis Ford Coppola had given this masterpiece with excellent star cast who did amazing screen presence... particularly Marlon Brando & Al Pacino were fabulous in their role. Story, screenplay & background score to it's best.
The movie is very long and the directing is bad to the extreme, the characters are badly written, the character who tries to be scary and the ones who try to be attractive but they are all vulgar, and the dialogues in the film are bad and also the drama is bad.
You have to watch it It's pure art The photography , the makeup , the production , the direction , the cast 10/10


I watched this movie two days ago, after seeing the rating which is quit remarkable but in the reality this movie sucks.

There are a lot of other options to watch so do not waste your time here.
Simply the best movie I have ever seen. I saw this movie as a pre-teen and have fallen more in love with it every time I've seen it since. Something about the perfection of each performance along with the dialogue, I dunno...it's just perfect. Coppola's (and Robert Evans') legacy.
"The Godfather" along with "The Gofather: Part II" are the best movies I have ever seen. Absolutely everything of it is magnificent, pure magic, gold, etc. The performances, the directing, the screenplay, the production, the script, the soundtrack, the film editing, the costume design, and the list goes on and on. The performances are excellent, all of them, through that you can see all the work the director Francis Ford Coppola made, which is one i truly admire. This movie is irreplaceable, a true piece of art. A classic. It involves love, crime, passion, negotiations, family, loyalty, respect. For me is just the perfect combo, because I love movies with violence, I also love movies with romance. I think there will never be a movie as perfect as this one.

There's no denying...the godfather is the best movie ever. To get the maximum 'godfather effect', simply watch I, II and III on a potentially boring sunday afternoon/evening and you will be stunned, amazed and above all very confused, because this whole movie is a total mindtrip. Believe me, your life will never be the same again and if not so, at least you won't sleep that night because this masterpiece will hit you...

VERY HARD.

Within three hours, the group portrait is complete, and the characters are evenly shaded, and there are no idle strokes. Many scenes can be called great. The environment, sound, lighting, and props are integrated. For example, when the hospital changes rooms, the editing is too good and busy. He never forgets the tears around the godfather 's eyes, which is suitable for movement; for example, the clip of baptism and killing is a thrilling one. The second generation of the godfather gradually sublimates and freezes in the intersection of joy and cold blood.
Marlen brando and el pacino are brilliant actors for sure, i can't describe how deep their characters are. I don't recommend anyone to watch this because he will never find a movie like this movie again.


the godfather is easily one of if not the best film in cinema history everyone gives great performances easily Marlon Brando and AL Pacino Frances ford Coppola directs the film well and everything is great the story is great and so is the film the story is convincing and many iconic performances and lines are featured James Caan and Robert Duvall give great performances the godfather truly deserves to be on the top of the greatest movie lists the plot interesting and manages to keep you watching throughout the film summary a stunning masterpiece that has changed movies forever and is easily going to be remembered forever the godfather is easily the best of the Trilodgy and was better than the best film of 1972 it could be the best film ever made the godfather is also good form watching before the godfather part 2
Dude it's not that good. Just sayin. IMDB-users just have to watch more movies so that The Godfather stops being on the top of every film-list on this site.
This is the perfect example of how to transform a story from book to script to screen. No derail spared no character left unexplored and no thread of story left unanswered. All the cast performed magically and this is one of them rare occasions when a movie literally outdoes any review. Brando Pacino Duvall Caan all deliver performances of a life time and bring to the screen one of the most powerful portrayals of how the mob is a family and that family is Corleone.


A work of art that will always remain on the list of the greatest of all time. I was a kid when I first watched it. I've watched it dozens of times. It fascinates with its details every time I watch it.


i just don't get the big deal with this film. i watched it once and it was OK, worth the watch but not the kind of film i think you could watch more than once. i defo don't think it merited a place in the top 10 films of all time. Also, marlon brando...i don't get it. yeah he was a GOOD actor, but i would never consider him a GREAT actor. and his part in this just seemed lacked something that should be there, i just didn't find him memorable. i suppose overall i didn't get this film the way others did, or is it just a case of people think they should like it so they just say that they do? i know that when people talk about it around me i don't voice my true opinion of it in fear of being hung by a mob :P
Its for reason one of the best movies ever, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are genius!!! This story is just so good, one of my top rated movies of all time.
The Godfather is probably the greatest movie of all time. The story, acting, script etc are masterfully crafted and executed, no other film can rival this piece of cinematic masterpiece.
The heavy storyline from "The Godfather" by Mario Puzo couldn't be better. The best acting performance you poissibly can reach, Marlon Brando does his greatest role ever as Vito. You really don't notice that the movie has some years on it's shoulders, stunning by Francis Ford Coppola. This one cannot be anything else than the highest score possible.
The best movie in the history in my opinion. Is great, emocional and with excellent performances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The final is epic too.
I don't know why i didn't see The Godfather till now but after watching the offer it was time for me to watch this masterpiece. And i was glad I watched it for the first time after I finished the offer. All i can say is this is truly one of the best movies out there.
Not too sure how this movie is not rated #1 on top rated movies. This is the movie that set the standard for all the mob movies that came after it. A picture that is truly remarkable as far as story, setting, and scope.

This is by far my favorite movie of all time. The performances from all the actors are on target. I have to say though, that I am one of those fans who has to put The Godfather I and the Godfather II on the same plate. They are equally my favorites and they are equally done to the same degree. Although II has its perks with DeNiro speaking Italian for most of the film. It's great. Memorable moments in the first one though are the entire film. Rarely does a movie come along where the entire film is memorable. Even the small scenes. I can truely say I love it. I never get tired of it. As a Italian-American growing up w/parents and relatives who memorized the movies, it is great to finally acknowledge them and say that Godfather is the best!
The Godfather is a good movie. That's where it stops. It is not a great movie in any way. Marlon Brando gives the worst performance in the movie, being at best pedestrian in his role, and at worst immensely boring. (Laurence Olivier should have won the Oscar for Sleuth or Peter O'Toole for The Ruling Class) Mercifully, the supporting cast was excellent - Duvall and Pacino especially. Caan was good as Santino, but suffered a bit in overacting his rages. Part of the problem with this film is the book it came from - the book is about 450 pages long, and has a complete story for just about every character on screen. Unless Coppola wanted a 10 hour movie, he just couldn't do that, which I understand. I'd read the book shortly before seeing the film, and I have a lot more respect for the book. I would like to see Part Two, given that a lot of people say it is better (I can easily believe that). I gave The Godfather 8/10, because, as I said, it is a good, but not great movie. Truly great movies include Life is Beautiful, The Professional and A Clockwork Orange.



This movie had actual mobster families involved in several movie decisions, such as removing "mafia" and "cosa nostra" from the script, as well as supplying the actors who played Luca Brasi and Johnny Fontane.
the godfathers a mafia organized crime film that was realized in 1972 and this takes place in the 1910s this is one of the best films that was ever made and its a brilliant masterpiece and the best gangster film ever made the story is about vi to do (Marlon Brando)who is the head of the family and is trying to get the family a lifetime and he celebrates his daughters wedding the Micheal(AL pacino scarface heat)returns from the army and is doing jobs for vi to his father i thought Marlon Brando was very very very fantastic in this movie for his acting and he won an Oscar for it.the whole films brilliant with the picture screenplay Marlon Brando costume dising story writing and the violence man its brutal in it overall 10/10 buy this u must see this movie
This film is the godfather to mob movies but not the best. Certainly doesn't do as good a job as some of the more modern films on the same topic.
One moment stands out above all in THE GODFATHER (no not the horse's head). It is the slow zoom on Al Pacino when he is revealing his plan to kill Solazzo and the corrupt cop. This is great characterization. It shows Michael Corleone's development from a seemingly weak boy urging to forget his roots to a man ready to take the family helm. The Godfather is possibly the most brilliant film ever put on tape. Oscar winner Marlon Brando is great, but it is Pacino who steals the show in this one. James Caan and Robert Duvall also offer up superb performances. There are many other famous scenes in this one, including the infamous "baptism" scene. The Godfather is filmmaking at its finest.

Thank you to the great director for making the masterpiece of history in which family relationships show us how the brother behaves with his siblings and his parents, and how they behave differently, how to keep their family identity, that smuggling has caused Destruction of a man, Convicted treason, Filled with persistent and meaningful dialogues, And much more ....
Do not do the things of the guilty heart, introverted, stable, brave, love family, not selfish, stand up for the people who love, although it is a man must see the film, but as a woman or learn a lot
First time I saw it, I didn't think it was the best film ever, but this second time... I don't know. Marlon Brando I love you. With my life. Vito Corleone is my favorite character ever (with Forrest Gump), Marlon Brando makes the character unique, perfect. Al Pacino, I love you. With my life. I can be like this with every actor in this film, because the actors are the best part. The script? Perfect. The director? Perfect, Coppola is so good. The music? Perfect. The actors? Perfect is short. In my opinion, Forrest Gump and this one are the best films ever. This is history. This is cinema.
I've never actually seen this movie, on account o' my Dad won't let me watch certain R rated films such as The Godfather (#1 on IMDB's top 250 list), The Shawshank Redemption (#2), American Pie, Road Trip, Catch 22, etc. I heard the movie was good though, and I trust whatever I hear if I can't prove it wrong, so I gave the film a 10/10. A must see.
The big problem with this movie is that people do not seem to realize that a movie is an illusion. It is pretend. It is make-believe. For some reason people think this movie is a historical document. People want to lock up Marlon Brando and Al Pacino for crimes their characters, not them committed. Ok let me try to break this down for all you people: The Corleone's are imaginary. They are not real. Someone made them up. They don't exist. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are real, but they are law-abiding actors. They are not criminals (as far as we know) Those things they do in the movies are not real. IS EVERYBODY CRAZY!#!!# I must be the only person who understands the difference between fiction and non-fiction. No, my 3-year old son understands that as well. As for the rest of you loonies, you can go hang out in Cleveland with all the other heathens, Osiris be damned!

3/10

As a film critic for one of the national newspapers, I often get asked the question "what is the greatest film of all time". For me, the answer comes naturally. "The Godfather". When everything is taken into account, from the acting, to the music score, it cannot be bettered. Those who contradict this cannot be as passionate about film as they think they are. Certainly there are other movies in the world, but take it from me, this is the finest piece of film-making you will ever see, it is a true epic. I will reveal nothing more, as I believe a film should be watched afresh, so that it has maximum impact. I would courteousely ask the person who wrote the page long essay on this site to restrict himself in future. Enjoy this film the very first time, enjoy it the second, indeed this is a movie that can be watched over and over, with the viewer discovering a new aspect each time. Enjoy the movie and revel in its greatness.
Some beware oranges We embrace the underworld Which bore film's great fruit

This should always be on top, The movie is classy stuff, Don Corleone is the best, And you will surely remember his quotes after the movie is over, Later on al pacino catches up in great pace I have seen all 3 part and i believe this is the best Of all. God Father " I will make him a deal he cannot reject" To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.

It goes without saying that this is a classic for the ages. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Mafia Godfather Don Corleone is one of the if not the best performance I have seen from an actor in a movie. When you add the young Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and so many other amazing supporting actors & Movie Magic truly happens. I felt like I was in New York at the height of the Sicilian/Italian Mafias reign the first time I saw The Godfather and am still captivated and entertained every time I watch this Movie. Mario Puzo is a wonderful writer and Francis Ford Coppola really knows what he is doing behind the camera this is the perfect storm a great movie making.
This movie has the right to be #1 in the top 250 from IMDb. Meta's have given it a 100/100 rating and the users have given it a solid 9,2. This film has been made with exceptional eye for detail and great artistic performances. You have to listen very well and keep concentrated every second of this film, because everything seen and heard appears to be a vital bit of information. It is the best movie ever made, with some of the best actors to have ever lived. Marlon Brando is a triple-A class actor and he shows it in this masterpiece. This is one of Al Pacino's first movies and he definitely left his mark, his performance has opened many doors for him, but most of all, it made the best movie ever!
This movie was one of the best movies ever made and it is the first movie made that cause me to be a film maker. Growing up I use to watch gangster movies and those movies reflected the neighborhoods and people I knew growing up. Also, I could actually feel like I was going through what the characters of this movie was going through.
Never hold a grudge against your opponent, it will make you lose your mind.

Among the all time greats for sure. As a major mafia/gangster movie fan, this may be my favorite and easily a top 5 of all movies I've ever seen in general. See all other top reviews for more sophisticated descriptions.
Well, there is pretty little to say about the bad side of the film, but about the good ones a lot can be said. The story was amazing, ahead from most of its time. The pacing was also incredible, one that wouldn't put you through boredom. I think as a film student, the film should be used as a study case for those who would like to write stories that could be translated into films. The actors were good as well especially the main character; one would have to watch to understand. How the dialog is held and how it translates to the character of the individuals in the film. The cinematography was fantastic; well I look up to be one so in short there use of color, shots, light is what makes the story even more interesting. I love the depth of their blacks and how they use the warm tones to convey some emotions and moods in the film. In short the film should be used widely in film schools for multiple purposes in the film industry.
i have only recently watched this film for the first time on TV. i didn't know what to expect i have herd great things from some people and not so great things from other people. i had previously never seen a AL Pacino film. then i watched what i believe to be the greatest film ever made and after looking at IMDb's top 250 list i realized a lot of other people loved it to. i loved it from start to finish i was immensely enthralled from beginning to end.this film has superb performances from all the cast. especially from AL Pacino who plays Michael coreleone the son of feared don Marlon Brando who dilverd another great performance. this film got me hooked on crime movies and on AL pacino who is know my favorite actor of all time and also the best. i wouldn't say every body will love this film it is slow to begin with and some people with no taste in film will say it is boring which absolutely incorrect. if you like films at all you have to see the godfather.
Tray to conpare this to The Avengers. Igrew up watching creativity from LA. Hollywood has changed a lot.
Nice movie and best action i watching. I am very enjoy this movie with my friend and good time when i relaxing also with all of my family in the home everyday to watching nonstop.

I just watched this on Netflix. Can't remember if i'd ever seen it but that's a good thing. I could compare it to modern cinema in a fresh way and I must say, despite the 3 hour length I was captivated the whole way through! Al Pacino and Brando brought this one home.

A masterpiece and one of the best films in Cinema history.
This movie is not as good as it is made out to be and very long. Most of the scenes seem unnecessary and make the movie overly long and boring.
This is a very good film. Just wanted to watch something and this film popped out nowhere. Gonna watch the other 2 film when iam free lol. Maybe iam left behind not knowing this film.
After finally watching this movie, I have to say that it was a little over the place with its plot. I feel as though the movie was trying to focus on too many things at once. The character build could of been better. For its time I can say that this movie would of been the best, but for 2021 and all the movies I've watched this movie doesn't even crack top ten IMO. I would watch it again with maybe my GF or brothers but wouldn't go out of my way too.

I really wish they had more character build in this and gave me more of an understanding of everything. I understand that the movie would of been too long but they rushed it.
This movie is perfect in every aspect of it, the script is to good, including lines that no script has ever equalled, and is true to real crime in the real world. The directing, producing of this is perfect, some of the best acting ever, the art directing is fantastic, costume designs fantastic, perfect is the word. This film is great to me because nobody had an idea like this one before the film, this film included great drama, not like other crime films which are just there for the explosions, and gun shoots. To me this film has the best ending ever, no ending has ever come near this one, maybe the second one came close, but nothing else. If you haven't seen this movie, and you're a big movie buff, I suggest you see this because this is the movie you can't refuse.
I honestly don't know what to say ... This has got to be the worst movie i've ever had the misfortune to watch and yet it's getting such good reviews. Why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me. Is almost everyone on IMDb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this? I found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it! My advice to anyone thinking of watching this - don't, it will only disappoint you. There is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging. Characters and events are boring to follow and personally I feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is given.
I mean where do i even start this without a doubt the greatest movie of all time and i really mean what i say this is like my 12 time watching this movie back and every time i fall in love with it even more the story the acting i really don't understand people who don't like it and often they say that they don't get it! I mean with all due respect if you can't appreciate how phenomenal this movie is then maybe the problem is in with you .

I had this classic on my watch list and it is certainly one of the best movies I've seen. What more can I say? That all production is perfect, music, actors without exception, history, etc. It does not bore and at all times keeps you aware of what will happen.
For me the 2nd best movie ever made. only godfather part 2 beats this, pacino is amazing in this film. the acting by brando is also amazing.
The Vito had shown his outstanding leadership in the movie. Quite learn a lot from him!Especially the quotes came out from his mouth. The bad-temper Sonny, weak Fredo and calm Michael have shown us the characters of human being. The godfather is not a easy job. He is a leader and must always take care to each other. He need to be fair and discipline.The traitors must be executed even though you are the family members.Really hard to be a godfather. By the way, I vote this movie 10 for the Marlon Brando!Thanks.
I didn't care for any of the Godfather films. I think they're some of the most overrated films of all time. Boring. I hate mafia movies. I think Donnie Brasco was better. I think The Conversation is a far superior film from Coppola.

What a great movie of all times according to me. It's simply a masterpiece. Loved every bit of it. Great performances by marlon brando and al pacino. It was soo real.
Oh my god this movie is a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola!! I'm gonna see this movie a few more times!! Go check it out someday it is so good!
The movie just mirrors the difficulties of gathering and handling power. Stabilizing your current level is probably one of the hardest things you can do, and it gives off the vibe that you should rise and open your eyes.
It has everything, fancy, the betrayal of a normal Mafia film but it is better. The ways the story go satisfied, and the end I mean wow. Everything is perfect 💯. Only one thing I don't like that too much character, it hard for me to remember all.
The rythm is amazing, the music is amazing, everything is amazing, it's a masterclass.

One of the first movies that gave transported me in through time and space to submerge me in the universe created by Francis Ford Coppola.
I like this movie for it's realness. It's really amazing how a gangster family fight to stay in their position.
I tried to watch this film a couple of years ago... since it is so hyped, and I'd never seen it before, I thought it would be worth seeing.

I was wrong.

Seriously, I found it hard to stay awake during the film - and eventually had to give up just over halfway through, and find something more interesting to do. This is a shame, because quite possibly it might have got more interesting towards the end - but it did not retain my interest for long enough. I did see the infamous scene with the horse's head, expecting it to be some cinematic masterpiece, but... no, even that was an anticlimax.
if you want to laugh, get the naked gun or mister bean; if you want adrenaline flushing through your veins, look for starship troopers or an arnie flick; if you want to cry, watch... i don't know, Meryl Streep? but if you want an the film you gotta see this. it has everything necessary to automatically be considered as THE ONE. the plot, the acting and actors (i love pacino, caan & duvall), the music, shocking scenes, etc. if you haven't seen it, well, what in the world are you waiting for? but, i hope you have enough time

I finally set out to take three hours to watch it this movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing The accents are amazing in this movie It is simply a great movie with great actors and great director I did get a little bored here and there it's too long But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever
My story with the Godfather started as a growth man, in fact i watchet it for the first time at the age of 21. I'll never forget when the credits rolled over and the music started play. A feeling i have only experienced a couple o times.

Everyone knows the plot, so there's nothing i can say about that. The only thing i can say about this piece of film making that has over 50 years old, is that we never ever saw anything like it again, simply because there is nothing that can beat it, is the perfect story, the perfect cast, the definitive screenplay. And that's it.

So, whenever someone ask you wich movie you can recomend to others, it doesn't matter the kind of film they expect, this will be always your first recommendation, if there is such person in the world that has not seen this masterpiece yet.
I loved the series of the films. when someone asks me what to watch the first thing that I tell them is to watch godfather. i will never get tired of watching this movie. It is the most perfect one for me. It has action, it has best actors and actresses, it has an interesting plot and most importantly it has very deep meaning in it. and every time you watch this, every time you understand more and more deeply go to the atmosphere of how the life was in Sicily at that times. Also I think that another reason that I like this movie so much is because of my personal preference. I like al Pachino first of all and watch all his films which a great pleasure and also I like the Italian mafia theme very much.

In one word, this is one of the mjust watches!!
I have'nt actually seen all of this movie, as unfilmenjoying as it may sound. I have seen parts of it, but not all of it. I have to see it sometime. But I got one thing to say. This is number one all time on this site. Nothing's better. Why can't the best movie around get a ten. I just want somebody to get this ten stars. It's the best, there's none with as many stars as it, and it can't get the most available? Give it a ten.
Good movie but a little boring, but it remains good and good for the actors
I have to say this film comes as close to perfect as any film in modern history. It is just brilliant filmmaking from top to bottom. The film boasts the greatest cast EVER assembled. Marlon Brando(Vito) gives one of the most captivating performances ever seen. Al Pacino(Michael) is just fabulous and mesmerizing to watch. His transformation from beginning to end was movie magic. Robert Duvall(Tom) was superb as always as the surrogate son. And James Caan(Satino) is just perfect in the film and gives life to perhaps my favorite "character" in all of films. He just lits up the screen everytime he's on it. And seeing Andy Garcia as his equally hot tempered son in Part III was a joy. The rest of the cast is flawless. There isn't much to say that hasn't been said already. The greatest trilogy ever is without question The Godfather Trilogy. And this was the original. 10/10
One of the best movies ever made! Best actors; great scenes, direction, location, production! We need more directors, actors, & producers like this to return to the US, operating on all cylinders! The story, although disturbing & bloody and vaguely based on true stories related to the mafia/cartel is so true to life.
Francis Ford Coppola must be a real perfectionist. The Godfather is an extremely artisinal film that can be compared to few others. The acting is unbelievable and the story is super intriguing. It takes the mafia world in a tone of 100 percent seriousness, unlike many other mob movies. The movie is also filled with surprises and loaded with powerful messages. Love it.
This film is without a doubt one of the best films in the world, and after many years, no film has been made with such power in my opinion. Let a film be made with this power again. There is little to say about the beauty of this film.
98 percent this the best movie ever made. I've watched and loved it at least twenty times.
A good movie is never responsible for setting up three views, but only expressing it, and then leaving the rest to the audience to choose.
Blablabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla
Good movie. I thought it was cool! In addition to having a lot of action, there is a lot of drama. The Godfather is the best movie ever, Michael Kyle said. In my opinion it is the best.
I rate 10 stars for movies that I watch again and again. But if I rate 9 the average will count down, and I can't do that. This movie is great, best than the book, a piece of art, and the favorite of my mom. She can watch it again daily; but I can't, a little long and slow to me in some parts. So, 10 stars deserved; but for my personal taste, 9.
Money or materialism is the embodiment of human greed and the way the gangsters go about their lives, breaking laws and committing barbaric animalistic acts of terror just for money is a poor cultural showcase to people around the world. I give it a 3 out of 10 as the characters at least dress well and have some sense of professionalism though twisted as it is.

The plot is actually quite simple and basic for a movie with such a high rating, there's a few thought provoking lines but other than that it's just the case of lawless organisations pitted against each other for the sake of money so if a mindless violent movie obsessing over money obsessed gangs is your thing then go for it and cheer your heart out for the amounts of money the rich mafia firms you imagine stole or received.
Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to "Goodfella's" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike "Apocalypse Now", "The Godfather" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the "Gladiator" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies.

"The Godfather" is the cinematic equivalent of Baroque architecture, excessive, gaudy and not worth the work to create.

The Godfather is one of the most epic movie of all times, this story is about one family and how they can change the society to achieve they goals. More than it is how a familiar drama can change our personality, the mafia way of life is a background to find redemption for our personal decisions. The story shows how a average man become a leader, for good and for bad, the process is hard and cost tears, blood and a piece of our souls. We learn from this thriller that we can't control our destiny, and even our reactions to life challenges isn't full of ourself, in essence great part of our acts is just instinct. This is the main argument and lesson here, we can't make plans in the long run, but we can train to respond to new obstacles. In familiar and professional career our dreams always will be submitted to the reality.
If you like the genre, go watch it. Better than the irishman.
The most memorable movie i have ever seen. I could watch it with my family or anyone, if you're looking for the go-to movie. The godfather should be on your list!!

F.ford capolla's best movie this slow pace and mafia atmosphere slowly draws you in and you go deep into the era al pacino's debut movie.f.ford capolla's best movie, this slow pace and mafia atmosphere slowly draws you in and you go down to the depths of the era al pacino's debut movie and actually it's not that big of a budget movie, but the effect it left on you is very big marlon brando is a great actor.
A great gangster movie, after watching I really learn a lot, such as: never let others know your ideas, the real master are not in the mood, the event is indifferent, have their own bottom line; A man who doesn't spend time with his family isn't a man
If you're Italian you will appreciate how Coppola got it right
This film, which is regarded as a legend, has finally been seen, holding a sense of sanctity to see the whole movie. In addition to my feeling of being blind to the face of foreigners, it's not bad. There are not too many stories in the last three hours that make you want to fast forward. At first, I feel that the godfather is a bad man, but it's only a matter of interest. At least he has his own principle and likes his saying: "a man who doesn't often stay with his family will never be a real man." No matter what happens outside, at least he does a good job in this aspect of family and feels happy at home What's more, I have also seen the sophistication of the world. Why can the godfather get the support of some politicians? Because they owe him more or less. In reality, it's the same thing. Sooner or later, what they owe others will be changed. I don't know whether I understand it or not. But the whole character of the godfather is complex and chaotic, and the actors are also soul level performances, Malone's saying "never let anyone know what you are thinking" should also be some of the top, undercover maxims.
What makes Batman different from hero movies is that it makes people feel more about darkness and human nature. Nolan's depiction of the character's personality color and expression of the inner action are incisive and incisive. As for the big scene, it is no less than other hero blockbusters.
If you like hopeful, surprising, never-seen-before characters, you will enjoy this amusing story of a family of prisoners victimized by the system and a Bible thumping pig.

Robbins and Freeman, and everybody else, gives perfect performances for their characters. Their actions and body languages are perfect for this story and movie.
This is the best crime movie after Scarface. The character are very iconic and al Pacino and Marlon Brando did a awesome acting.
Hi i'm rosette , thank you for connecting with us and it's help us best serve you and others, Can you take 1 minute to leave a review about your opinion with us? Thanks for your support!"

This movie is so hyped up and i say this before watching part 2 it was incredibly dull. I felt very little emotion towards any character and overall i think it was a slow start and was not interesting until the last hour or so. Still a good movie but wouldnt watch again.
Well, how else can you explain the fact that this creation is in 13th place in the TOP 250 films, and on IMDB in general in second place? Only the desire of people to conform to public opinion, to admire everything that many people admire, and thereby allegedly bring themselves closer to supposedly elitist art. This happens not only with movies, I note, but also with musical works. How often can you come across another 'Mozart - Requiem for a Dream' bullshit on some website, when in fact (I think you know this too) the author of this melody is Clint Mussel.
Well, after all these years and this movie remains a masterpiece. What can i say, the acting performances (especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino), the script, and the director's work, all were perfect. It's one of the few movies that they can describe as life-changing. But the reason i rated it as 9/10 is because of the time, this movie was perfect but too long.
There is nothing I can tell you here that hasn't already been said. Spectacularly spellbinding performances, great story helmed by a great director.

10/10.
Ok, I'll admit, I liked the Godfather, but #1 movie of all time? That is sickening! A good movie is not a movie that is "fun", if it was, then #1 would be a bad James Bond movie. Any movie that is close to the top 10 should be a movie that gives you MEANING outside of the theater, not a movie about false organized crime! How the hell did this movie get #1 if it's just a movie about killing? The only movie I can think of that should get #1 is American Beauty.

Having the opportunity to see the performance of Marlon Bandon and Al Pacino in the same picture is a luxury. The performance of Al as Michael is greta, to see the transformation of his character from a war hero to the most dangerous capo of the moment.
Such a beautifully made film, talented actors and all and all show the power of the film in that decade, well done

Pictures speak more than words. After watching this, one would reflect on the current trends in movies that you may call modern.
A great and most loved gangster movie. Godfather is a very simply made movie with full of crime elements going on in it , concern about family , royalty and fate - mixed with very expensive and classy production putted brutally in front of us is the best thing I've ever seen in my life. No doubt Francis Ford Coppola is best in making crime dramas and actors like Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as two crime gods ,just❣❣👌. Every single scene of this film is like inspiration and self cautioning.

If you haven't watched it yet then what are you waiting for . It's pure entertainment and a perfect cinema .

Inspiring, strong acting, wonderful direction, full of political elements and events in the name of business, thought provoking and an adorable chemistry between a son and a father .

It's hard to find bad aspects about this movie. It captures the mafia life perfectly, the actors are so good, the story is incredible and the drama is so fascinating that makes the movie extremely intriguing.
It's hard to say what they could've done better. Much like Titanic, everyone fits their role like they were born for it. It ages well and pays a hefty price, and it's smooth and has legs. Like any fine wine, this classic will be put on the topmost shelf of the cellar.
The storyline, screenplay and casting, couldnt have been any better. This in its simplicity is the metrics and the kinetics of a pefect cooked pot of delicate stew, seasoned to perfection.

I liked this movie and gave it 3 out of 2 thumbs up for te acting dynamics and realism!
It doesn't matter how many years go by or how many times you watch it, this will always be one of those 10 out of 10 master pieces that will never get old.
Unfortunately, today we can no longer watch such quality movies. This film is powerful, a good script, an excellent casting, an excellent acting and a top direction. It's hard to fine a film made so well, it's 29 years old and it's aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mobster movies, he or she will watch the entire movie, the audience is glued to what will happen next as the movie progresses. It's about family, loyalty, greed, relationships and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style makes the film memorable.

I have heard the huge uproar about how great this movie is and I was looking forward to seeing it. I had high expectations so I don't know how that affected my opinion, but I think the movie was a complete waste of my time. I had seen Road to Perdition not even a month before it and consider that movie to be far superior in an intellectual standpoint, considering the magnetic performances of Tom Hanks and Jude Law. The only somewhat decent acting in The Godfather was done by Al Pacino and Sophie Coppola. I almost fell asleep watching this thing. I do not understand why it is such a classic. It was a waste of my three dollars to even rent it!
The original Godfather is an epic that will live on in world cinema until the end of time. The only movies that come even close to its brilliance are Godfather II and The Usual Suspects. It is the most griping 3 hours of cinema you will ever watch. The acting is magnificent. Brando's whispering, hoarse voice is easily identifible to people even in the present day. Pacino gets started in his brilliant career with a memorable performance as Michael Corleone here. Even James Caan as the tempermental Sonny and Robert Duvall as the wannabe son are terrific. Francis Ford Coppola cemented his place in the Hollywood hall of fame with this epic that will never be forgotten.

My rating : @@@@@ (out of five)
"The Godfather" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.
I saw today again and again and again idk how many time i watched and every time i learn something, this is best movie of all times!!!!!!!!
Every Film maker has to watch this film, is like A Encylopedia for Film makers and we can say as bibel for film makers, lot of film makers insperied by this film and it became. Dummies for film makers, lot of aspering film makers tries to copy this film and got awards.
What can I say here that hasn´t allready been said about The Godfater Part I. Yes, Pacino and Brando in the grestest Roles. Yes, a unmatchable Story. Yes, it has fantastic Music and finaly Yes it should be called the Greatest ever.


Not often you will be able to find a film that is as good as the novel it's based upon. For sure the reason in this case is that Mario Puzo also wrote the screenplay. Fully recommended to read the book and to watch the film, in either order. Any more comment needless.
Now I understand that this film was groundbreaking... but it didn't do it for me. Marlon Brando was impossible to understand and the plot was so hard to keep a track of. It definitely got better as it went on but did seem to drag for a bit with unnecessary scenes it felt like it should've been a series. I didn't hate it in the slightest and will be watching The Godfather 2 however I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a captivating or lighthearted film.
No.1 Movie of all time? I think that's what ruined it for me, I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours.

Everything about it just lacked in moving me, the vengeance was untouched, parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched. Thoroughly this was the most disappointing film I've ever seen, not the worst, just the most disappointing. I'm not trying to change anyone's thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad - just in case anyone gets the impression.

Thanks
I really don't understand, and don't want to understand, why people are obsessed with this type of movie. Every violent scene makes me sick, and I don't want to go back to any of them. I even think that to treat such a film as a classic, even if it is highly skilled, isn't it secretly instigating more people to worship violence? Damn manly. It amounts to violence in some ways.

The Godfather don't need to somebody's advice to watch. this is a nice movie with fantastic cast. actors are truly amazing. but the movie doesn't have an attractive beginning. or sometimes it could be boring for somebody.
The first time I saw this movie in the theatre, I was 19, and so taken by it's theme, because there had been nothing like it before. That scene with "horses' head" in the movie exec's bed..was really great!!! I immediately asked my Italian friends, if that could be possible..... they said..."yes, in the 'old' days...not as many cops,and no forensic stuff available then to get caught!" However, some things weren't realistic...such as...Michael's naive wife(Diane Keaton) constantly interfering(he would have gotten rid of her,long ago)and Sonny getting caught by himself, on the causway...you 'always' take somebody with you, (men can't avoid to be careless)... Anyway... a great film...a collectors' item..now for sure....
I just finished watching "The GodFather". I've recently watched a lot of movies here. But I've seen this movie several times with my friends & family.

Awesome Movie I have ever seen.

Ratings 10/10. Love you the movie maker.
I watch it 2 times.one of the best movie ever. The Director Francis Ford Coppola is done his great job.and Marlon Brando acting is fantastic.
This movie is by far the best. I have not watched the sequel yet, but either way, I think we can't rank Part II as the best just because it's a sequel. But all acting is uniquely perfect. There were unbelievable twists and crazy violence for 1972, but I love it. There clearly is not a better movie out there.
It's been a few years since I have seen this film, but it is definitely one of the all-time classics. I would give it a '10' but I find the length drags it down a little. Other than that deserving of belonging in the Top 250 films. However, I would not give it #1. I would have to reserver that honor for Sergio Leone's "The Good The Bad and The Ugly". "The Godfather" did give us some awesome performances, one of the only Brando roles I truly enjoyed. As well my 2nd favorite Coppola film (1st being "The Conversation").I think it's worth repeat viewing, and a definite keeper in a movie lover's collection. Bottom line a solid '8', with a desire to see it again soon.
I agree that The Godfather is a classic and one of the greatest movies of all time but it bothers me how many people think it is absolutely perfect. It is not perfect, but it still probably deserves the number one spot. It is definitely the best mob movie ever made, but I don't like how people live and die by it.
No! But it is in the top five. The Godfather is the king of mobster and mafia films. It goes where no family has ever gone before. Marlone Brando is The Godfather, the head master of the family. His raspy voice is copied by people all over the world, but is never mastered. The Godfather is such a great film. But, I do warn you though. It's a long,long film. I think it's about 3 hours long. If you don't like sitting there for 3 hours watching a movie, then watch it hour by hour. It's a hard decision to make..if The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Some people say yes, others no. I say..and I stand by this..The Wizard of Oz is the greatest film of all time. Yeah, yeah, I'm picking Oz over The Godfather. The Godfather is #3 on my list, which is a pretty hard list to get on. You must watch this film. It's one of America's classics. This comments has taught me many this. It taught me..keep your friends close..and your enemies closer. That's in part 2..but, Hey! Who's keeping up?

Truly the best movie of all time, except for perhaps Part II. Marlon Brando is unforgettable. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone- probably one of the better performances on film. Ever. The cinematography is gorgeous. The end comes together very nicely, though the loss of Michael's innocence through his first hit is heartbreaking.

Male growth movie, telling the story of a child becoming a gangster boss, this is the best gangster crime movie I have ever seen, which is very shocking.
The scriptwriter and the performance of the magic of the numerous strokes, can be found in "The Godfather" to the audience "big screen" experience is enough to refute those who oppose.
If you like mob movies, I guess this movie is for you but if you not be cautious. It is bloody and sad. It has a lot of themes and colors to describe the story, which is very interesting. If you really like this movie, I would recommend The Road to Pedition with Tom Hanks. It is not as bloody as this movie but it has a good plot. Godfather has a good plot but for me, it is just too much to handle. The movie would probably get away without so much blood but I guess you have to be realistic. I probably wouldn't watch this movie if I didn't take humanities, which is one of the requirements for my associates degree. Although my brother would eventually make me watch since he is a big mob fan.
Gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension. Music relieves light sadness and conflicts of human nature in interest game. Whether it's acting or the use of lens or music, it gives people a kind of beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie is extremely need to sink to savor, and whenever you turn it out, you can have a new feeling.
I just want to say it's one of the best movies from Hollywood and I loved it thoroughly... the style, cinematic effects, characterizations and above all dialogs of the movie touched my heart... character of Al Pacino is simply tailor-made for him. James Cann also performed at his best. Background score of the movie is truly appreciable. Camera work and editing is superb. Winning 3 Oscards is too natural thing for The Godfather. This is my first comment in this site and I hope it will be useful for other users... I love to see this movie again and again and it's like a text-book to film industry whether it's Hollywood or bollywood.
This is one of, if not, the greatest movies ever made. The acting. The story. The cinematography. The costumes. Absolutely nothing disappoints. It boggles my mind how anyone would be disappointed. I just watched this with my 18 year old daughter and she loved it. That's an opinion from someone who has a hard time keeping her eyes off of her phone! Genius!

In my opinion "The Godfather" is, in every way, the best film ever made.
This is the most powerful and greatest movie ever made. It has its mistakes (see the goofs section) but I am sure many would agree with me. Marlon Brando delivers the best acting performance in movie history and Francis Ford Coppola directs brilliantly, no matter what Robert Evans or Paramount thought. I think Bob Evans should have shut his mouth during production of this film because he would have ruined its greatness had Coppola lost his will to direct under his constant complaining. Al Pacino delivers a slightly good performance, Jimmy Caan delivers a great performance along with Robert Duvall. Several quotes and scenes make the movie memorable and to this day, powerful. This is a must see for anyone. 20/10.
Honestly this review is going to be short because this film is excellent in any field you could imagine - visually amazing, acting more convincing than any movie I've ever seen, the score is iconic and the screenplay is so vast in scale, but manages to be amazing. if you put the end of this movie next to the start, it wouldn't make any sense, but just as all great films, it makes sense anyway while immersing you into the cinematic experience. If you haven't seen, then you need to free up a morning or evening with or without friends and watch it with your undivided attention.
The first time I saw this I was speechless. This is obviously the most excellent film ever. With a near perfect cast. A great Director. The music is one of the best things about it, I love the Godfather song. Almost every scene is unforgettable. A Perfect Film!!!!!!!
The Godfather is not only one of the best and most memorable movies, but also one of the most beautiful movies in history. The film, which is not only full of power struggles and betrayals, but also shows a family that is always behind each other. A father who, while being the biggest criminal in the city, loves his children so much that he is ready to kill the whole city by losing one of them, but for the sake of the other children, he forgives his son and finally dies playing with his grandson. And of course, in the end, his little boy takes revenge on the whole family in the best possible way and becomes the first power again. You know, the godfather is a combination of blood and love. And if we want to describe it in one sentence, we can only say: THE MOST PERFECT MOVIE EVER
I do not like old school movies, but it is my number movie off all times. There are certain things in life that are so exquisite that 26 Alphabets seem inadequate to adequately explain them. They go beyond the limited scope of the 26 alphabets. Instead of rating or reviewing such things, you should personally experience them. One of the most exquisite motion pictures and television shows ever made. I mean, if they were able to make such high-caliber films in 1970, which the most skilled individuals are unable to do so in 2021, then the folks who built and developed this were truly ahead of their time. It will be unusual to see this 1970s-created, 1950s-based sitcom in 2021. I have a tendency to screenshot the moments that would make the most stunning posters.

The Godfather is a beautifully created mafia film. The thing about this movie is that every character has a complicated personality.

The old generation of godfather's calm, calm, deep eyes, with a vague tone about the dignity of men, the words "I will make him an offer he can't refuse" let me have a deep respect for this role. Another mission depicts sonny, the elder son of the godfather of the older generation, who is hot-tempered and bent on revenge after his father is shot.
An ordinary man, who broke his throat and couldn't find a serious listener, but the slurred godfather, no one dared to ignore every word he said. He is always expressionless, but there is a power that cannot be ignored behind him-an elegant rage, calm cruelty, and makeup evil, like a mixture of viper and tiger.
Laying the foundation for the story, the translation takes a scriptwrit-like approach to presenting the story to the reader. The whole book is as steady and slow as an Italian opera.
I think people here have said pretty much all that needs to be said about this film. Just watch it if you haven't done so already, this is pure quality regarding plot, acting, music, everything.

I think it's the best movie ever made, but I wanted to give it one star just to see what would happen.

Now they're telling me I need 150 characters to publish the review. Hope this does the trick.
It's a great movie, realistic and perfect movie of all time. Must watch I recommend it. It's a masterpiece. The acting of a movie is a also very good. If you want to watch movie which is realistic then I recommend it. If you like.
The plot is not complicated, but it gives people a profound impression inadvertently.
I know how annoying it is with long comments so: GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE! It´s the best movie ever made and nobody can make a better one! The actors are completely wonderful and Coppola has created a masterpiece! The sequels are great, but this one is the best part of the trilogy! Some people may find the movie slow, but can they say that the story is bulls**t? Not likely... 10/10!!!!!
The film is stunningly good, gripping and entertaining. It shows a superb shooting technique, so that each character is molded into a three-dimensional image. This movie could be called "man's bible". The charm of the godfather is unique in that all the interests exchanged and the right family values and the love for friends allow you to see yourself again from your own world view. It is a far-reaching romantic epic gangster movie.



Plot and everything is good, but there's one thing I do n' t like. It seems that men need to think a lot, take a lot, but children and women don't. I feel a little sexist.


What can I possibly add to all the comments that have been given? I think the true greatness of this movie lies in the fact that Puzo and Coppola both worked on the script of these movies. Directors often get a book all wrong and screw up the translation from the book to the movie, and that's only logical, because a book is art and that's personal. THe movie would have been completely different if Coppola had written the screenplay on his own without Puzo telling him what the real essence of the story is. And that is what lifted this movie and the other godfathers beyond greatness... I give a 9 out of 10.

Watched 2019-11-29.

An altogether enjoyable watch. The acting is quite exquisite, the story is captivating and there is no wonder as to why this movie is deemed one of the best classics of all time.
There isn't anything more to say about the Godfather that hasn't already been said. Words simply cannot describe fully how good this movie is. Has arguably the greatest acting ever, excellent direction, screenplay, storyline, everything is perfect. 10/10 A masterpiece
yes it was produced back at 1972 but till now it's the best movie for all time.what an epic,once you open this film you will take a trip to the mafia world and you will be a member of the corleone family.I felt that Coppola was drawing this movie with his hands,he was like a magician playing with his tools.brando gives us the best performance maybe in cinematic history.i can't believe that this was the first movie(worldwide production)for Al Pacino,he was iconic,the way his character alters alongside the film was nearly impossible to be performed by anyone and be convincing but Pacino did it like he was born for it.Duvall was so smooth and Caan was so serious that you feel they are those characters at real life too.every single actor deserved an Oscar for there performances in this masterpiece.Mario puzo created a perfect novel and then made an even better screenplay.Coppola handled this film like he was waiting and preparing for it his whole life.
Without a doubt, it is the most cinematic triumph of its' kind...the narrative goes beyond the lens, it delivers an all star performance from the gritty dark family crimes of the early 40's ....... The performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Robert DeNiro and others were superb. Let's not forget some of the best lines from any film that every Italian / Italo-American and Gangster lovers still to this day pronounce them with the garb and audacity to catch a laugh.... LEAVE THE GUN, TAKE THE CANNOLI... The Godfather, the ultimate Mafia Movie....
Everything you want a film to be, this is it. Amazing character(s) development and story that keeps you interested. All the actors seemed to be born to play these characters, especially Brando and Pacino who are at their finest.

Might just be me but it's overated. At the time i'm sure my grandad loved it but it just didn't do it for me. Go watch Goodfellas
This right here is cinema at its finest, this film has immediately broken into my top 5, and it is pretty tight up there so high praise to Don Carleone. Such a well written, well directed and well performed masterpiece that has definitely stood the test of time

It's perfect for my current mood. Reccoment it everyone
Well the Godfather is really one of the best adaptation of novel to book. I know that there are probably few of the newer viewers of this movie who read the book, but if you first read the book when the book first came out in the 70's and waiting patiently for the movie to be released you weren't disappointed in the movie. I think it is the best gangster movie and if you are fortunate to own the DVD you are in for a treat. There are lots of goodies here.

This is a movie that is just a good story and it makes you feel fo this family.
Gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, music soothing light sadness, interest game human nature conflict. Whether it is acting or the use of the lens, music, give a person with a kind of beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie is extremely need to sink down to savor, and whenever it comes out to review can have a new feeling
Self feeling is more attractive than the first step. Hahaha, it's really pretty good. There are a lot of movies that men must watch in their lives, which teach them to behave

The Godfather's discussion of religion looms large, with the boundaries of good and evil blurred by grace, warmth, kindness and family. The godfather upends the conventional wisdom about the gangster. Instead of being a bully, the gangster can be gentle and gentle. The director orchestrates mass assassinations and deftly USES a cross-montage of revenge. When Marlon Brando spoke in the calmest of voices that he would make an offer he could not refuse, the violence of the underworld was maximized and great aesthetic tension was generated.
Some people say this movie is way to heavy handed, especially compared to today's movies and movies Gen Z people like.

As a Gen Z, I disagree. This was amazing and deep, I loved it. This movie definitely deserved the love it got.

It is an absolutely a action packed blockbuster movie. What a movie by ford, evergreen blockbuster movie.
This film is a mafia version, but without the existential philosophical depth of The Brothers karamazov.

They took the structure of Dostoevsky's book, but without having the same depth, and set it in the mafia.

After seeing the first two Godfather movies again, I'm reminded how much their success is to the eternal credit of cinematographer Gordon Willis (and the production designer & actors), and how much the great fraud of Francis Coppola being a talent is held up entirely by his collaboration with people like Willis, Vittorio Storaro and Haskel Wexler in the 70's and early 80's. For all those people out there who still think that The Godfathers are the greatest movies ever, just remember to give credit where credit is due.
This is the greatest movie of all time. The writing, directing and acting were all splendid. The acting by James Caan and Al Pacino was the best. It was only topped by the acting by Robert De Niro in the second one. If you have never seen this movie, you are crazy.
I'm not saying it's my favorite film, THE SHINING is my favorite movie of all time, but I have to say: this has to be the greatest movie ever made.

Like I said, The Shining is my favorite, but I enjoy this one. It is another one of my main favorite movies. Marlon Brando is the light of the screen, in my opinion, in which was his best performance ever. Highly recommended. Skip part two and three, see Part One!

A GIGANTIC 10 out of 10.
The God Father Part One is named by this web site to be the greatest movie of all time and for good reason. This movie is a tale of mobsters but as the movie goes on the viewer begins to relate to the mobsters. This movie is a feet of writing, directing, and filming. Music set to this movie fits perfectly to each scene and sets the mood for that scene. This movie has nothing to do with most people's real life instead it has to do with their dreams of wealth and power and is a great movie for any one who has ever dreamed of wealth. The main character in this movie evolves from one who is dead set against becoming a member of the family to the head of the family this transition is the focus of the story and is told and shown very well.
The godfather Must be the best film ever made? The story is so good and the filming by Coppola outstanding There are also so many smal details in this trilogy that are used in other films as a refferens. and the preformans of Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen)is exelent..

You can se the same exelent filming in "Apocalypse now" in these two films you can see some of the genius that makes Coppola films so great!

The Godfather nr:1 Apocalypse now nr:2

Vito Corleone is Don of the NY crime family. He acquires fame and fortune by himself after immigrating to US from Italy. He has three sons and the youngest son, Michel lives honestly with no connection with gangster's business. One day, Don gets hurt by the other crime family that against him. And Michel decides to retaliation.

This story is far from my real life but I was very interested in it. I felt parental love from that Don want Michel to live not like him. Don is a great person and that is reason why he becomes Don. I think Michel does not have to fight against the men. But if I were him, I am sure to do same. This film is apparently full of violence but indeed full of humanity, emotion and love. I recommend you to watch it if you want to think about your human nature. You must be able to learn a lot from Don Corleone.
I find it extremely disheartening that people would complain about the length of "The Godfather." Unlike most movies of the three hour duration, I find that when I view "Godfather," not once do I look at my watch or think about how long it is. And that is simply because it is the closest thing to perfection on film that we have yet to see. Never once do I question it when I see this ranked as the #1 film on various lists. Coppola, despite a shaky career of hits and misses, created a structural story so memorable and unmatched that it must have the three hour length to fully develop into a nuanced story, setting the stage for its successors. And I challenge anyone to find a more memorable screen performance than Marlon Brando. So for those of you who don't like three hour movies, you'd better stick to the 90 minute masterpieces like "Cruel Intentions" and "Gone in 60 Seconds." You'll probably understand them better.
"The Godfather" is a masterful film, rich in every component essential to it's development. Along with the terrific story-line and plot, the characters and the actors who play them really make this movie. One cannot help becoming deeply enveloped in the film with all its terrific elements fitting together like a jigsaw puzzle. It is truly a film masterpiece.
This movie if so we can call it, because is more than a movie, it's the greatest union of artist, starting with the director finishing with the composer, stepping between the actors. Even if it's not a movie made by a "true" Sicilian, it smells like Sicily. Coppola presents to non-Sicilian spectator the gloomy charm of "my" arid land. It's not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone's speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA
i think this might sound wrong but i think this movie was alright. but as well as the first one I've got to give its props but in my opinion it doesn't compare to the second one. but i did not love it also think thank al pacino was the best actor in this movie. and i also believe the second one is far better than the first don't you think i meen come on please much more theatrical more excitement of course even better acting but as well as the the boat seen if you don't think this movie as as good the first one i think that there might be something you missed in the second like the boat seen or lots of stuff but you've got to remember it is just a movie ;>
The Godfather has been a tradition in my family forever. Even when I was young I wanted to see what this "wonderful" movie was like. Finally, when I was eight, my whole family got together on New Year's Eve to watch the trilogy and The Godfather became my all time favorite movie. There is nothing better. I've seen the movie a million times, and never get tired of it. I also enjoy watching the little documentary before the movie, but that totally spoils some of it if you haven't seen it before. My family says I like Part 1 more than Part 2 because Marlon Brando was in it (yes, partly, but he's my favorite actor), but the story was so much better. Many movies that are based on the book tend to add ridiculous scenes, but the Godfather kept true to the story. All of the actors were wonderful, and now, the Corleone family is like a part of my family.
100/100 You have to see this masterpiece. Trust me. I saw The Shawshank Redemption and it's good, but I refuse to believe that that its in any way shape or form any better than this glorious film. A true MUST-SEE in any list of good movies. I truly hope that if any millennials should be offended by this movie they should and need to die...





Slowly.

The gentle rhythm contains huge authority and tension, the music soothes the faint sadness, the interest game human nature conflict. Whether it is acting or lens, the use of music, give people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this film is extremely need to sink down to savor carefully, and no matter when it comes out to relive can have new thinking.
This movie is a timeless classic. I have never seen a movie that matches its excellence nor do I think I ever will. Brando rightfully deserved the Oscar he received for the movie (although his performance in On the Waterfront was better). The AFI list says Citizen Kane is the best movie of all time, but Citizen Kane doesn't come close to reaching the brilliance of the Godfather. Coppola got everything right and made the right choice of choosing the no-name actor Pacino (at the time) for the role as Michael. There was also James Caan and Robert Duvall that played their roles superb as well. I have probably seen this movie over 60 times and every time, I realize I'm watching a masterpiece in film. The character development is also outstanding. I would extremely recommend this movie to anyone interested in knowing about the great movies of all time. Superb 10/10.
The Godfather's discussion of religion looms large, with the boundaries of good and evil blurred by grace, warmth, kindness and family. The godfather upends the conventional wisdom about the gangster. Instead of being a bully, the gangster can be gentle and gentle. The director orchestrates mass assassinations and deftly USES a cross-montage of revenge. When Marlon Brando spoke in the calmest of voices that he would make an offer he could not refuse, the violence of the underworld was maximized and great aesthetic tension was generated.
Still the best and even better with recent 4k transfer. When they released the blurays they did the originals a disserve. It was nice to see them take the time and attention to details and truly restored this classics to its original state. Better dare we say?
True, the film was about the Mafia, and in the minds of the Mafias are usually depicted as violent, ruthless, anti-people and cruel, but in this film it can even be said that the Corleone Mafia, and Vito Corleone, the Good Mafia is shown! A godfather who cares about those around him, sometimes does justice to them, his family does not care about him, and he does not use his influence to trade drugs and pays for it! Of course, apart from the differences between Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone, the film finally comes to the point that when the mafia, and business and work take precedence over the family, you will kill people in the general way and have to commit crimes. Who knows, maybe the world of politics is the same, with the difference that there is no escape from it ...
NO NEED TO SAY ANYTHING TO PROMOTE THIS MOVIE. A CLASSIC.

The Director of the drama hit `The Godfather' Francis Ford Coppola, was unique at directing this film. There seem to be a lot of transitions in this film and mystery. He also was sneaky at who is the real main character.

The movie is full of suspense and disbelief, The casting director was remarkable at finding the right people to play the part. When watching this movie ask you self one question, do you feel sorry for this family, that's full of hatefulness and war? I asked my self that question and yeah, I did because of the way Coppola took the movie apart and pieced it back together in a different way. The transitions are some-what noticeable and there are others when you might have to watch it again to see it. The one thing that could have been changed was when ever the Italian family or even when ever they were speaking in Italian it was hard to understand what was going on, but it also could have been used as a tactic to throw the viewer off. Another thing that could have been changed was the timing was difficult to comprehend, between 2 days or a year.
A masterpiece. An amazing film. Brilliant performances from everyone. The directing of Francis Ford Copolla was unbelievable, the cinematography was flawless, along with the script. Also the original score was very, very good. The film is filled with amazing lines that you can't help but quote.

An enthralling film which grabs you hold and doesn't let you go until an hour after the end, because you think about it for so long afterwards. One of the best films I have ever seen and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys Scorsese or anyone with an interest in organized crime. And come on, who doesn't like a bit of organized crime?
One of the most successful movies ever made in Hollywood. Inspired me to study acting since I was 19 years of age so hard and become an actor in my country, Colombia. Spectacular work of acting in actors like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Michael Kane, Marlon Brandon and the whole cast. The crew had to be amazing to, in order to make such successful film. Bringing a tragic story from reality to the magic world of the movies, so many people can enjoy it. Today seems the time has not past and it is very pleasant to enjoy amazing acting performances of each actor and still learn from each peace of scene. It will never past away and will stay as a classic, hope it can be around for all new generations of actors, directors and producers. Wish some day I can share tables and set with great actors like them, who have been inspiring and example in my work and professional life as an actor. Thank you all.
The Godfather is definitely my favourite film of all time. It is never boring. Brando's best. He won an Oscar. The film is absolutely irrisistible. It's original and is perfect on the telling of a mafia empire falling down because of a deal that was turned down. Pacino became a star for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. This is James Caan's best film and is the only film that got him an academy award nomination. Other people that became noticeable are Robert Duvall and John Cazale. For sure it is a 10. I recommend it to everyone. It is not a film to say no to because everything is going right down the line. I am sure it will not be a turn down. I am saying this because I know that it is one of the best films created. It was #3 on #100 of the afi's top 100 films list.
I'm sure you may want to argue with me. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. This is a terrific movie on many levels. Pacing, Script, Lighting, Sets, Everything is top notch before you even get to the superb acting. This film demonstrates the ability to show violence in a shocking way and some people used it as a normal function of business. If you want to know what my #1 mob movie is...see Miller's Crossing. This is the best of the Godfather trilogy. Another bone you'll probably have to pick sometime. My favorite thing about the movie is probably the sets and locations. Choosing a favorite line is difficult. I appreciate the relative small use of profanity. "He's been struck by the thunderbolt"
I actually have never seen the classic movie and was really impressed and understand why it holds the status that it does in American Cinema. The locations and set were beautiful and spot on with the theme. I thought everybody looked like they belonged perfectly. The legendary scene with Don Corleone where he is in his office on the day of his daughter's wedding. The lighting and shadows in that is really impressive. Another one of my favorites that show how a movie can take you on a journey. Forget about what's going on for a couple of hours. When Michael was in the bathroom of the restaurant and the train was passing by and you see him searching for his pistol. I think this is a great example of great cinematography, acting and writing all coming together to create a larger than life scene. Being in a theatre it emphasized everything by a ton. You could hear the train as if you are sitting in that restaurant. Notice all the lighting and shadows I was really impressed!
Its the godfather, what could go wrong. Only had problem with the little Italy part. Great editing. Mafia family told in a poetic way.
A masterpiece of a movie with great cast, very good script, good acting and directing. It almost feels like you are in the movie the whole time and you stumble upon these emotions surrounding love, loyalty and systemic hierarchy.

The only thing about the movie I have a problem with is that it sometimes becomes very long-winded or boring in that sense, but if you have a good amount of time on your hands and a lot of snacks, it shouldn't be a problem at all.

A 9.5/10 from me.
I think Francis Ford Coppola has delivered an amazing analysis on family traditions with The Godfather, which I consider his masterpiece.

Considering that it opened in 1972, and analyzing all the violence-full sequences, it is not strange to read about it as "shocking" in several reviews.

The Godfather and The Godfather part II are some of the movies you just HAVE to see. In part II, F.F.C. tells two stories: Vito Corleone's acension to power and Michael Corleone's new life as the new Godfather.

I'd give them both an 11 out of 10.
This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made. The characters are wonderful and the action scenes are intense. A must see movie. A perfect **** out of ****.
This is the #8 movie of all time. Classic scene after classic scene. Symphonic violence. Vengeance. Great characters. Characters that despite their violent nature you sympathize with them. You want to be Don Vito Corleone. There's not one flaw in this whole movie. You wish it was even longer. Seeing this as a child I wanted to grow up to be Luca Brasi. All elements of a man's movie can be linked here. Honor, Revenge, Violence, Separation of love and sex, loyalty, omerta, and family. There isn't a single second in this 170 minute movie that drags. There's great dialogue, great scenes, great characters, great acting. It's very difficult to choose among them. My only wish for this movie is that they had filmed more of Luca Brasi. He has plenty more explanation in the book. But all in all this is film making at its very very best. And it's just fun to watch.
This film is true classic - One of the best films ever made BAR-NONE. There are the obvious reasons for liking this film - firstly the plot is wonderful - how one thing leads on to another.

Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were electrifying as Vito and Michael but in my opinion the star of the show was James Caan as Sonny - he is probably the most memorably brilliant character ever, also turning excellent performances were the superb but terribly underrated John Cazale as Fredo - The disregarded brother (he would shine trough in part 2) and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.

The most memorable scene in my mind if where Sonny gives his brother in law Carlo a slight beating with a dustbin lid.;

A true classic and JUST better than the sequel
This is my second comment about this film - I am just pleased to see that there are some film fans with the sense to recognise that this motion picture is superior to any other.

And that a lot of you are realising the true supremecy of James Caan as Sonny.

Respect to everyone Any Godfather lovers out there feel free to E-mail me.

Like gangsta,mafia,and drama? This is for you! Its a great movie and i thing the best movie of mafia at all!

So watch it or i will make you an offer you can't refuse

Representatives of Italian churches and triads 'successful people in the capitalist countries such as the United States have escaped, stolen, established, avenged, whitewashed growth history, and mixed the generation and destruction of family, love, and friendship in different situations. . Family interests are above everything else, and everything that is not conducive to the growth and development of the family must be eliminated. The coexistence of interests is the foundation of harmony, and the divergence of interests is the beginning of hostility. The death of the old godfather, the birth of the new godfather. Is the beginning of an unstoppable ending.
While certainly a little overrated, the Godfather still holds up as an amazing movie with some of the most iconic characters, moments and lines in all of film. The story is a crime drama that follows the leader of a massive crime family passing the torch to his youngest and most reluctant son. The genius and appeal of the story not only lies in its well executed structure and masterful dialogue, but also the realism and accuracy with which it tells a story about the mafia. However the film would be nothing without the characters and the actors that play them. Al Pachino is indeed fantastic in the film, and Robert Duvall is also good, but the film belongs to Marlon Brando. His performance as Vito Corleone is legendary and the character has become one of the best and most loved in all of fiction. This is an absolute masterpiece, though not quite the greatest of all time, and will remain a huge part of film history forever.
This film really opened my eyes to the drama of beautiful cinematography and how compelling you can make an image simply with the framing. Having each shot tell its own story is an incredible element towards crafting an excellent film. In addition to the cinematography, I became a huge fan of Brando because of this film. I read that he used some personal techniques to craft his character and I really admire that now that I am looking for ways to make my own screen-time unique and dynamic. I wish films would continue to use The Godfather as a model for good cinema. There is something missing from modern movie-making that can be rediscovered by watching films like this.
Shows powerful men's life. Its not just a movie for quickies. careful watching gives you glimpses of handling creatures of emotion and fear. its not exaggerated. But it is generally applicable in civilized society when leaders have emerged. Another interesting thing is usage of sound. A lot of sound and scenes are composed without dialogues. Light, silhouette, symbols of shadows are heavily used to 'frame' godfather. even you can hear a lot of family sounds without meant for any literal communication to the audience. baby cry, Italian conversations.. Bit lengthy and dialogue oriented. Only watch when you have peaceful time.
An old patriarch of a mafia family tries to submit his power to his son through violence and chaos. The Godfather is the typical mafia story, masterfully written by Mario Pulzo. Marlon Brando brilliant performance and a young Al Pacino great acting make this one of the greatest film of all times. Winner of 3 Academy Awards.
This movie is widely regarded professional movie critics as one of the greatest films of all time.

I myself am in one-hundred percent agreement with this assessment.

Fifty years on from release what can I add to the canon of reviews that has not been said? This! For you young people (or anyone else) who have not seen it yet or seen it but not start to finish I say the following. Block out some time and watch it beginning to end on one of the streaming services. No watching it on AMC or TCM with all their commercial breaks. Dont watch it over two nights. It is long but to fully appreciate it, do yourself a favor, and watch it all at once!
This iconic film is a legend, and for good reason. The a thing, cinematography, plot, and script all as good as it gets. If you have any interest in film and haven't seen The Godfather you are doing yourself a great disservice. Go watch this film!
This film is a masterpiece. The acting is as good or better that any other film in history. Script is beautiful written. Almost every component of this film is on par with being the best film of all time. The only aspect I disliked is the time. This film is almost 3 hours. It truly becomes a choir near the end to finish it but it is well worth your time.
I didn't think i would ever give a movie a 10. There is always something to say. I watched the godfather when i was younger and recently watched it again after 15 years. It is a true masterpiece. Everything is perfection. The characters and how they develope, the storyline and the way it is filmed. The olschool music is just the icing on the cake. I already liked it in my childhood, but fell in love rewatching it. It's just a trip through nostalgic perfection, enjoying every second of it.

Phenomenal! One of the best movies ever made. Great acting! music, screenplay! Great directing. I can't express my feelings with just words. One of Hollywood's greatest films. It may take a many viewings to fully comprehend the film. I wasn't ready for what this movie had in store for me. This movie will pull you in each time you watch it. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story is great, the characters are very carefully chosen. Al Pacino's performance is very good.. This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films ever. A piece of art which will live in the hearts of many, This film is a brilliant mob movie, that everyone should watch. Everyone I know loves this film. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give give great performances in their finest movie ever. The amount of work put in The Godfather is just amazing! I can feel each character's emotion in this movie. I give it 10 out of 10
This is how I watched the movie. I watched first 1 hour then left as such since I was bored. After 3 months, I watched the movie again, this time I could enjoy it very much. The movie is showing how powerful Godfather really is. No major plot twists or anything like that but it's a great gangster movie. The movie is made up of many independent scenes, the first scene itself is catching. Must watch, a little bit lagging if seen for the first time, yet a good movie.
I could watch this movie again and again. Marlon Brando is spectacular, and you envy and pity the Corleones at the same time. They seem to have such a strong sense of loyalty and family, yet they are constantly watching their backs and wondering when their time is up. The struggle of the Corleones to eventually become legitimate is dramatic and sad, but beautifully portrayed.
I really it hate when I'm flipping with the remote and I come, once again, upon "The Godfather". No, it's not because I'm bored with it after seeing it 1,000 times. It's because it is still completely captivating and totally enthralling every single time I see it. And, I can't turn away! It is and always will be, my favorite movie (along with and equal to Part II). As others have said, skip Part III. Or, at least, enjoy it on its own terms and don't try to compare it to or even think of it as a part of a trilogy of Parts I & II. Part III is the "Let It Be" album of Francis Ford Coppola. (You Beatles freaks will understand).

"The Godfather" is not a masterpiece. It is THE masterpiece.
When I first saw The Godfather I sat speechless for about 15 mins. The movie just took my breath away. Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn't seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time. Sure Citizen Kane was great, and so was The Shawshank Redemption, but let's be real... There is NO comparison to The Godfather. Whether you like gangster-movies or not, this is one you can't miss!!!
This film will forever stand as the truly greatest of it`s time or of all time.You will not find a better movie anywhere and if you don`t think this film is great,well you got a serious problem. I thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for this film and I hope we will see Coppola back in action soon. The acting as well is brilliant and Marlon Brando as the godfather,he is just amazing.This film only recieved three Oscars and it should have got more. This is a film about the mob or the "cosa nostra" but it is also a film about family and friendship.It`s a very touching film and a very beautiful film. This is the ultimate film and I love it. So it doesn`t get any better than this and to all of you out there who haven`t seen it,you don`t know what you`re missing. This is the BEST!!!!
Unarguabaly Coppolas finest work The Godfather centres on the corleone family's rise and near fall in 1940s gangland America.With the retirement of Vito Coleone(brando) and death of his thuggish succesor Sonny corleone(caan).Michael corleone(pacino) clean cut college boy previosly uninvolved in the family business makes the transition to cool,cold and ruthless don(head of the family).Following a series of deaths and betrayels Michael does away with all opposition to secure the family's place in power. Featuring some of the most intelligent and brutally executed death scenes ever filmed and the finest actors in the business the film is not just a hugely entertaining epic. The godfather deals with many themes such as power,violence,rites of passage,love and betrayel.With a fantastic score, great direction and fine assembled cast there is nothing i can think of to critisise the film. Be prepared for part two
I think it is the most brilliant film of all time. Perfectly cast and symmetrically structured. The rising of Michael to unwillingly become the Godfather after realizing he's the perfect mix between brother Tom and Sonny, give this film the perfect balance between irony and destiny.
The Godfather is one of the best important works in the history of the movies. It tells a story about the gangster.And it is the greatest gangster film of alltime. We can not only catch a glimpse ofthe life of the gangsters through this movie, but can know the principle that wehave to accept something we dislike, forthe duty, or someone we love.In the really life, we may have to accept something sometime, like the Michael.Maybe we may feel unhappy or angry. Butin a people's life, it's always the situationlike that, and we have to experience them.

Must watch before you die

No words can define this movie.
This is the second best film ever made. Only "The Godfather part 2" is better. Nothing else need be said, but since I ave to get four lines I will point out that Pacino's transformation in this film is one of the most moving performances in history
I don't know why this film became the most overrated movie of all time. To me(and a lot of people), it was just a regular gangster movie, nothing more.

I was lucky enough to watch this movie in the theaters a few months ago because of its 50th anniversary. At that time it was my second time watching this film, and it just gets better the more you watch it. I literally had goosebumps all over my body when the movie started. I can't just sit for long periods of times and watch something without doing something else, but with the godfather, i always sit still and watch.....great!
Al Pacino is a young and sullen US Marine named Michael, back from risking his life for his country in the Pacific Ocean, only to find his family has degenerated into an anti-American crime syndicate. Torn between patriotism and love of family, he decides to report the whole regime to J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. But when his father is shot (by Hoover's G-Men no less), Michael instead senselessly chooses to start killing Americans, including a Police Captain and a Turk. I'm sorry, but I couldn't understand the character's motivation in that scene, it was rude and it spoiled the whole meal, if not the movie. Otherwise I think you'll like it for the wonderful Sicilian scenery, the post-war N.Y. look, and for the scene where Sonny bangs his girlfriend against the door while his wife fumes, Tom laughs, Connie marries, Fredo slobbers, the Don waits, and Michael whines through his nose.
I waste money on no good film. I write now because I mad. All talking, no thing else, very boring. I like alien vs. hunter better.

Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Omg, why did I wait so long to watch this classic?! "What's the matter with you?" 😎😃 #Godfather.


I don't see what so many others see in this movie. It is choppy, the characters are undeveloped, it is not very well acted, and it is boring. If I hadn't read the book, I don't think I could have followed the movie. There is little context in the movie story line without the book to fill in the gaps.
with no doubt,the greatest movie of all time.loyalty,family relations,business,power,authority or enmity are all in the movie,but while wathcing they are all invisible,when it ends,you can feel them strongly. No producer can shot something better than it.It is an offer that human-being cannot refuse.
I was hoping when I wasted this but i don'tRemember it getting that good. Maybe I will rewatch and if so I will review it again
The Godfather is the greatest movie ever made and it is one of the few movies that doesn't have a single flaw in it. The direction in the Godfather is superb and he acting in the movie is excellent, Marlon Brando gives us one of his best performances. Frances Ford Coppola makes the movie focus more on the family than on anything else and is much more than a gangster movie, it is more about family. The Movie is a film noir perfect in every way. 10 OUT OF 10.
The AFI rated The Godfather the third best movie ever. Only citizen Kane and Casablanca were higher. I haven't seen citizen Kane, but I have seen Casablanca, and that can hold a very, very small candle to this masterpiece. In this movie nothing is gratuitous or useless. The dialouge is perfect. Even though this is a three hour movie, all the scenes still stick in my mind. Only great movies do that to you. If you see it, you'll see what I mean.
The Godfather is an American classic, because it contains basically everything a great movie needs. The flawless performances make the movie incredibly realistic, and the cinematography and score make The Godfather even more effective. Practically everyone who watches it falls under its spell in the first or second viewing. A film of such power deserves to be considered one of the greats. However, the trip to Sicily is pointless and time consuming, which takes a point off the grade.

RATING: 9
Its hard to describe the acting in this film, but to me the acting was so artistic that it felt like I was watching moving art in a film metaphorically speaking. Even if you are someone who doesn't like gangster films, I feel like this film can be enjoyed by an audience of any genre. The way the story was acted out and slowly unraveled throughout the movie was beautifully done. My favorite character obviously was The Godfather himself, I can't picture any other actor being able to pull off what Al Pacino did in this film and this is one of the big reasons why is one of my top five favorite actors. This film had everything from romance, action, drama, horror ( in a way). One of the very few movies I ever watched and couldn't think of anything I didn't like about it
One of the only films I have seen that is perfect in every regard.... The Godfather revolutionized the gangster/mafia movie sub-genre and changed filmmaking forever! Would give 11/10 if I could.
The director launches this romantic gangster epic in a gloomy and calm style, and discusses more about the relationship between rights and crimes in the alternation of rights.
The film, at first glance, tells the story of an aspiring young man who degenerated into a Mafia boss. However, if you think about it more deeply, you will find that it is actually a process in which people choose between survival, integration into the environment and changing the environment so as to complete themselves. To go a little bit further, it's about how people's beliefs change people.
Among One of the best gangster movies And the characters are never forgotten by us
This is the textbook of how to do gangster movies. There are more than 1000 movies am sure inspired by this movie world over by this epic. Acting, Cinematography, Makeup, Action name any department and this movie excels. Have watched it for more than 100 times yet it never fails to amuse me.
Godfather is about mafia families and how they handle their business. We follow the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) is the head of family and a very powerful man while his son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) he tries to stay away from their dirty business. Marlon Brando was excellent in this film every time he was on the screen I was captivated. His facial expressions and his silent dominance is what you expect from a "Godfather". Remember any man who must say "I am the king" is no true king. You heavily see how important family is for a mafia man(and italian also) and how everything revolves around it. While Al Pacino portrays beautifully the son who slowly tries to learn the ropes of the job. The movie has heavy dialogues and the most scenes are people talking then acting for brief moment then talking again I really liked that , its not fast-paced not slow-paced either is just the perfect combination. Music was really good , I feel like if the music was not on point we will be talking for an entirely different movie whatsoever. Definitely a must see.
Disgusting awful bad cringe. fsardhgfgvuhfafsdsafsaf sadsadsadsadfsafdsdfsaf fsdafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsa
This movie is not one of my favorite crime movies but it is still very good I never read the book but the movie is just amazing such as The Godfather 2.
Honesly couldn't see what all the fuss is about. I felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film. Good actors boring story and even worse directing!!! Perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently, and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers, producers, and directors? I don't doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the 'God father' sorely outclassed. It is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay-day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating it.
The Godfather is the best film about the Mafia that has been done so today. He not only accurately portrays the disputes against rival families. The film also shows the whole family psychology that involves the family and relatives and friends who live with the family of Don Corleone. The wedding scene is one of the best scenes in the film, kept showing the Italian traditions, even though the USA The scenes of struggle and war between rival mobsters is also taking the breath. This movie is one of the few sequels that had the same quality of the first movie without losing quality. Not enough watch the first film we got to see three movies in a row ... hugs
I enjoyed to how the movie present the mafia world with to much details and reality , great directing form frances capola 3 hours without any boring you watch a masterpiece to three hours and legendary screenplay, moment, quotes, discussion are memorable.

And the best thing its the acting marlon brando it's the godfather of the actors ,all pacino with great acting ,all the cast do an amazing job a great perfect job from all...!
That's a little to what the film says. The film is like a work of art. For the first time in a movie, I've seen all the actors play well. spectacular script and acting, management. A big hand for everything.
Godfather is the classic great movie of all time. It is movie perfection. It is the most incredible masterpiece. Its like watching magic on screen, it like viewing your first baby being born. It flows like butter. it never gets tired, I've watched at least 20 times and I'm still amazed. Infact I might just go watch it right now. You should too and if don't have the Godfather Collection DVD go buy it. And keep it under your pillow when you sleep.

10 out of 10.
The original Godfather changed movies forever. The major studios became less important due to its indie makers. I cannot say anything about this film that has not already been said. It is a masterpiece with only its second part and Citizen Kane able to compare to it. The acting, writing, and directing are some of the finest ever to be recorded. Al Pacino peaked in this film with his subtle, yet absolutely effective, portrayal of Michael. Marlon Brando delivers one of Hollywood's finest performances, with the raspy voice and arched eyebrows. James Caan also found his perfect character in the emotional Sonny. Francis Ford Coppola does the finest piece of directing I've ever seen, and Puzo and Coppola's writing presents the audience with memorable characters. Sterling Hayden also steals a scene or two as the police captain. A film that defies time and repeated viewings.
The more we watch it, the more we see the perfection in the movie.


One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.

The Godfather is not only the greatest movie ever made but can arguably be considered one of the best acting movies also. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuVall give mesmorizing performances in this classic about the inside of the crime organization known as the Corleone family. But it also tells the tale of Michael Corleone(played by Al Pacino) who, at the beginning, attempts to get away from the family business and move on his own. But as the movies progresses, Michael becomes more and more attached to the family, and eventually becoming the successor to his father, Vito Corleone. The Godfather is filled with a great storyline, beautiful acting, and a gruesome showing of the crime family.

Few other films revel in their sheer pompousity as 'The Godfather.' I must say that I do not dislike this film; it is a classic and deservedly so, and still one of the best gangster movies. Its just it tends to take itself too seriously, and you can't really relate to the characters. Don Corleone is not as violent and ruthless as expected (he fails to take revenge after Sonny's death). It would have been more thrilling to watch the Godfather carry out a brutal payback executive or unparalleled brutality.

The film was too slow and long for my tastes, and lacked action and suspense. The best scenes include the scene where Al Pacino has to kill an enemy of the family, near the end when Don Corleone dies and of course the memorable 'Machine-gun death' of Sonny.
Legendary performances that remain some of the best ever given from an all-star cast, iconic cinematography, and some of the absolute best, most human character development that ever made its way to a screen.

Adaptations aren't usually this faithful or brilliant. This movie and the book it's based on influenced society for a reason, they are landmark achievements. Very, very few movies feature characters that bring so much to the screen, and the study of power in The Godfather series will forever be etched in history for its brilliance.

The 1970s was the decade for films as art, more than any other decade. It's a shame that the modern era is dominated by the likes of The Avengers.
Still the best. All gangster films and tv shows wish they had the class Godfather does
Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.
This is most movie spots to be watched Best movie ever
My reviews are designed to be short, sweet and to the point and this is my first! Superb cast, all the actors played their characters convincingly and with authority. Some people may find the length of the film too long but in my opinion there isn't a dull moment. This film is both classy and brutal at the same time and nothing and nobody should turn down an offer they cannot refuse.

Considering the problems encountered in the making of the film, Coppola does a fine job and the film is a well deserved masterpiece that should be in everybody's collection. All I can say to you now is, if you haven't seen it yet, go and buy it!
For some reason I got bored, couldn't watch it all the way. Maybe a few years later I'll try again. People always change. Maybe then I'll like it. The acting and all are certainly good, it's only the storyline that is not to my taste in my opinion.
In my humble opinion, this film is one of the best films ever made! True masterpiece of cinematography!

One of the best crime movies of all time. Masterpiece by ford coppola
Well, it is no.1 on the list, and on many others, very influential an all. But I have trouble seeing this as the greatest movie ever made.

Sure it is good, excelent even, but not at all close to being the best. I feel there are other movies that are more better, some of which came before The Godfather, and are generaly more important.

I hope I can understand why this is what it is soon.
Everytime I watch this movie I feel the need to go into my back yard and build a shrine to Francis and Marlon... What the heck can I add to what everyone knows, or should know, about this MASTERPIECE!! I would tell you how many times i've watched it, but you wouldn't believe me...

Easyrider606
The epic story equaled by only 'once upon a time in America'.
Definetly my top 5 movies. The brilliance from all of them is just different. The way the portrayed each character and how well the director did. I'm starting to think i might become an actor after watching this.
The greatest movie ever made. It is perfection! The cast, acting, story, music can't be bettered. I've watched it hundreds of times and never gets boring. If there is 1 film you should watch this is it.
Don't hate your enemy, it will affect your judgment.
I really don't understand why some people loved it so much. I agree acting by all actors is outstanding, but this movie is about a crime family and it glorifies the criminals of the society. Criminals are volves of society which prey upon sheep (good people) of the society,they use evil and immoral ways to become rich and powerful. Criminals must not be glorified. Please stop promoting such crime movies. All crimes movies should show a terrible fate of criminal who either has to spend rest of life in jail or is given suitable puinishment for his or her crimes. I did not live the movie as it glorifies lifestyle of criminals.
We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of "The Godfather," which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.
No words to say about this masterpiece. The art of film making.
Marlon Brandon and Al Pacino are just awesome...!😎 Moving is soo good... Especially the dailogues of the movie are just like attitude quotes...!😎 every one in the movie is given importance to their characters.... ! Just awesome...!
I can say that this movie is a sophisticated version of Gangs of Wasseypur and if you like watching crime world then you'll love this film.

I personally don't like gangsta movies because they do not have much respect for their women. Though I liked all the Italian accent in this movie.
Amazing acting, amazing direction and screenplay. Marlon Brando at the top of his game with what could be the most recognized performance in movie history. The Godfather introduces us to a very talented cast with a initial wedding scene that presents us with all of the different personalities that are part of the Corleone family. The plot of the movie revolves around Michael Corleone, a role taken by a young Al Pacino personally picked by Francis Ford Coppola even when the studio heads wanted someone else for the role. It was Al Pacino's big break deserving an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. This movie is first about family, secondly about power and politics and lastly about necessary violence...all summed up to make for a very special movie, one of the best ever, if not the best.
One of my absolute favorite films of all time. A masterpiece without any compare in its genre. Please note that there is not one detail to complain about in this film. As much as I love Part 2 the original is in a class for itself. 10 out of ten .. no doubt.
One of the best movies of all time, so much talent behind and in front of the camera!
It is impossible to describe in words how good this work is. Incredible atmosphere, great dialogues and believable characters - it all adds up to the best movie ever.

Sorry, but i can't believe that this is the most popular film, it dragged on for so long i didn't even see the ending. Don't get me wrong, i love gangster films but this was so unengaging and that by the time Al Pacino shot the 'Bad' copper i had to turn off.

The storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didn't care about whatever happened to the characters. How stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemaker's bed, he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind?

I can't think of any reasons why this was a good film, if you do then you better tell me!!
I hope they remake this movie maybe then that nonsense will stop, but then again once is enough. I swear people just claim it to be the greatest of all time because it's the COOL thing to do, most of them probably haven't even seen it. It's long (really, really long), boring and pointless. Marlo Brandon (Archie Bunker called him that) was a terrible actor.


A stellar cast for a timeless, brilliant and spectacular classic film. A milestone set in the history of cinema by three big names: Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The best Mob film ever made, pioneering in many aspects: camera movements and shots, poetry of light, actor's work in pauses full of meaning and tension. The work of production designer Dean Tavoularis and costume designer Anna Hill Johnstone were very meticulous and truthful and created that impact of truthfulness that served as an indispensable support in the unraveling of the intertwining of a terrible and shocking but tender at the same time story, always exciting. A film that gives you something more at every new vision.
Three words to describe this film... BAD BAD BAD... Not worth five minutes of your time... Goodfellas and Casino are lightyears better. Ok, maybe that is a little harsh, but seriously, this is not one of the top 250 movies of all time... it does have some merit, so maybe overall it deserves a 5.0/10 ... but, given that this movie is lacking in so many other areas, I have no choice but to award it a 1.0/10.0

RGV is survived by making The Godfather series in Hindi. I loved this movie Rating 8/10
We have reached an era where technology is at its peak .. but we go back 50 years before where cinema created works of art... one of them is the Godfather.
This one has it all. The casting, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the plot twists. It is simply almost above reproach. Many say GFII is the better movie, but because it tells 2 stories instead of one, my nod goes to the original Godfather.
The Godfather is without doubt one of the very best drama films ever. The directing is excellent, the scenes are really beautiful, the dialogue is of very high standard, but most of all: the acting cannot be compared with anything I've ever seen on film (perhaps with the exception of the follow-up "The Godfather, part II").

Marlon Brando is always Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino is almost as good. The Godfather is not just a cool gangster movie, it is also about how fragile life is and the impossibility of having total control over a situation.

The war between the New York mafia families shown in this movie is similar to most struggles for power, both on a smaller and a larger scale.
Francis Ford Coppola's movie about the Corleone family is the story of the ultimate Hollywood family. Although "The Godfather" has lost some of it's original steam. In 1972 the causal treatment of violence was beyond shocking. With films like "Natural Born Killers," "Goodfellas" & "Pulp Fiction" (any Tarantino film for that matter) savage violence done in an "every day life" manner is no longer as shocking. Although there are a few scenes that stand out, even today. When Michael Corleone paid back those gentlemen for the attempted murder of his father. That is one of the greatest scenes in the history of film. And of course the scene were one of Mr. Ed's comrades makes a cameo. The most amazing thing to myself is how much of a family this really is. The Corleone's love each other, and that shines through above everything else in this film. But even with all it's greatness it lasted too long. So this great film just doesn't make the 10 cut for me. 9 (would be 9.8) out of 10.
I remember when I was about 13 when I first watched the Godfather. I turned it off after half an hour. Three years later one of my friends had it on video. At first I was reluctant to watch it, but I became entranced by what I saw. Not only did it contain probably the best ensemble cast I have ever seen(Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Shire), but it is also one of the greatest stories in modern cinema. The predominant theme in this film is not violence or power as some might say it is, but family. Without giving the film away, the most moving and evocative parts of the film are when the members of the family are involved. I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Brando's work (Apart from 'Apocalypse Now'), but he deserved an Oscar here, for one of the greatest performances of our time. Caan, as the explosive 'Sonny' should have got 'Best Supporting Actor' too, as well as other magnificent performances by Pacino as Michael, and Duvall as Tom. Watch this film, you will NOT be disappointed. The greatest film ever? Probably-a definite 10.
I am one of those dorks who knows virtually every line to this movie? Why? Because the characters move with that timeless, understated intensity that no other director gets quite right. Coppola manages to give these brutal men a razor thin layer of humanity, and we're hooked along for the ride. We despise Tattaglia, Brazzini, Carlo-everyone who threatens the dynasty.

And of course it ends with sublimely just revenge. Who can ever forget Carlo kicking at the windshield while Michael looks out from his window?

A lesson in filmmaking, these is easily one of the greatest movie of all time, I whited a hole two years to get the right mode to watch what every body describing as a masterpiece.

and now its one of the best movies i have ever saw .

One of the best ever and it actually showed the reality of the fake personality of public elected politicians and real mafias
This movie is a definitely best movie. Everything includes in this movie are just perfect. The acting, the theme, the score, the Cinematography and the lighting, I can't write it's greatness. I watched this film 10 months ago but I still can talk about the scenes without any mistake. I watched yesterday but if I watch today it still gonna be cinematic classic for me.
All of my 21 years of living, I had never had the desire to see The Godfather movies. I didn't care much about the Mafia or anything related to it. Then one day, I was a little bored (I do live in Lubbock ya know) and I started watching this movie. Wow. Great acting, great mood, great everything. This is basically a perfect picture. Francis Ford Coppola brought together everything and made the film very realistic. And let's not forget Al Pacino's stirring performance as Michael Corleone. Great flick. Too bad George Kennedy's not in it.


Ich bin der Meinung das der Pate der beste film ist wenn es um Mafia filme geht die Handlunge ist einfach super die anfangs scene ist Legänder und es ist super zu sehen wie al pacino langsam zum Mafia boss wird Ein muss für jeden Film Fan und erstrecht für jeden Mafia Fan
I think that whatever I say, I do not give this great movie its due. It is truly a legend among films, Also, there are no films so far that blow up the style and workmanship and one of the best produced in the 2000s.


There is a reason that films are called the greatest, and The Godfather proves it. Coppola paints a chilling picture of the Corleone family, while the cast, particularly Brando and Pacino are unforgettable. If you haven't seen this movie, then "whats the matter with you"?
When Michael and Fredo drive up in Vegas to meet Moe Green, that clearly was not Fredo in the car. Could have got a better stand in with the same receding hairline.

This film is Francis Ford Copollas best work together with The Godfather Part II.It shows how mobsters ran and still run their families and that its origin truly is Sicilian.

Al Pacino's big breakthrough and it's justified.The actor performance by all actors is fabulous.Never in my life have I ever seen a maffia boss so real like Marlon Brando.That's probably why it was copied by many others.They're all fabulous but Marlon Brando is just so awesome he almost blows you away.

I haven't given a film a 10 but I did it with the Godfather because it's the best maffia film ever made , if not even the best film ever made...They've got my vote on that too...
Its a movie classic no doubt, but be prepared it's so long. The things happens really slooooww. Thats it thak's.
The Godfather is definitely a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Probably the best Crime movie of the 70's. Plot: When Vito Corleone, a mafia leader, is wounded by another mob, his son Michael steps in and takes a part in the family business. Michael kills the people kills the people planning to get in their way, and then heads off to Sicily to hide. While he is gone, the family goes horrible downhill as the empire falls in a post-World War II during the 1940's. The best thing about the movie is that it is so interesting seeing the Mafia up close. It is so smart and brilliantly made by director Francis Ford Coppola. Wonderful acting by Brando, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall. Great film-editing and some of the best characters ever made in Hollywood. An excellent achievement. Best scene: Michael "excusing" himself from the restaurant from the police.

10/10 stars.
Without a doubt, this is the greatest movie ever made!

It has everything! A great cast, amazing acting, and an interesting plot! I am surprised that Al Pacino didn't win the Oscar because he put on an amazing performance.

As well as Marlon Brando who well deserved the Oscar for his spectacular performance as Don Corleone. I heard a lot about the iconic horse head scene, and it still surprised me because that is NOT the way you want to wake up!

After seeing this wonderful masterpiece, I am so excited to see the sequel!

Derirative, contrived, moronic in parts, inexcusably slapstick, horrendously acted, monstrously ill-informed, soul-wastingly aimless, incompetantly structured, amazingly awful dialogue, virulently hideous casting, monstrous over use of toilet humour, inescapably stupid bodily function gags, insanely complicated plot, innumerable plot-holes, a myriad of anachronisms, baffling directorial ineptitude, spectacularly pretentious and alienating, superbly bad costumes, terrible make-up, manically dire soundtrack...

...are all NOT faults of this quite splendid gangster epic. Liked it quite a lot.
Why did I give the Godfather an 8/10 instead of a perfect score like so many? 8/10 is still a good score in my book, but why couldn't I award those two extra stars. It's considered by almost all to be a three hour masterpiece. But, there's my first problem. It's three hours. Not that I despise movies that run for this long, because some certainly do have the content to keep that run time entertaining. This one, however, gets boring and slow at times. When I say this, I am mostly referring to the Marlon Brando dialogue scenes. I cannot get over the way the words fall out of his mouth as he mumbles them. Why he did his dialogue like this, I have no idea. If there was a reason for it, I stand by my rating. Don't get me wrong, this movie was anchored by great performances and writing, directing and cinematography, but it did not require three hours to be told. Many call it a masterpiece, I call it a good film.
GOAT! Plain and simply the greatest movie ever made.
I grew up seeing occasional glimpses of this movie on tv. I thought it seemed interesting. I loved the opening wedding scene and I strongly remember the scene where Apollonia is killed.

Sat through it tonight since it' son Netflix and it's AMAZING. It has everything. Romance, drama, terror, suspense, and even the occasional slight sense of humor. This is a powerful film.

Most people strongly respect the Corleone family. Their values are very simple. Family over everything. Loyalty is the number one value. Avenge those of your family who were unfairly murdered.

If only the real Mafia kept to these real values. It would be a better world today.
This is by far the best movie ever made, despite being a low budget movie. Almost fifty years after its release there ain't no movie that can describe criminal life in us and at the same time include so much history. Watching this movie is like read a whole library of books.
The Godfather is a masterpiece in cinema directed by Francis Ford Coppalla and based on a novel by Mario Puzo, and starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and john Cazale. Tells the story of a mafia leader named vito corleone (Brando)who looks for a succeeder to the family and two of his sons are part of the family business as where his third son Micheal (Pacino) Swore never to join his families business but when hears his father almost died in an assassination attempt he drifts slowly into the mob underworld. superbly acted and directed and you are a fan of drama and crime movies then you need to see this film 10/10 absolutely brilliant film.
Just about as great as a movie's ever gonna be. As for the storytelling, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass.

Well, to say something about this movie is rather easy because you know that every single serious movie-goer would agree that this is one (I would say THE ONE) of the best movies ever made in heaven or hell. Then why should I comment on this one? Because this is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE and I want to make that clear... :)
THE GODFATHER undoubtedly remains a masterpiece in motion picture production and is probably on the top ten list of best films ever made of most movie buffs. Based on Mario Puzo's highly acclaimed novel of a fictional Sicilian American crime family, it is a dramatic and realistic portrayal of the trials and tribulations of life, liberty, and justice in the "underworld". This film introduced moviegoers to the acting genius of Al Pacino and reemphasized the unique talents of Marlon Brando, which won him an Oscar in his splendid portrayal on Don Vito Corleone, the founder and titular head of a powerful mafia family. (p)

This movie should be seen by everyone. The captivating performances by distinguished entertainers coupled with a touching plot of family honor and loyalty will have the audience glued to their chairs and not lose interest even though this movie is well over three hours in length. Superb job in directing by Francis Ford Coppola!

I never thought it was going to be that good, Al Pacino was just perfect, the way Coppola captures the italian family essence was just amazing, the music made me get into the movie, and although it was so long I did not feel it...one of the best movies I'd ever see

If you haven't seen this movie, then you're missing a part of American history. Open your eyes to one man's struggle against the many, while he tries to keep his family and a promise to his father. If you have a close relationship with your father I highly recommend this film. If you don't, I highly recommend this film.
The Godfather has got to be the finest film ever made. It has all the ingredients of a great film. Directing, being Coppola's first major film, he does an astounding job of recreating Mario Puzzo's novel. The acting is top notch, with Brando and Pacino really shining and supported by the likes of Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The script is breath taking and really pulls you in to the story.

From the opening scene to the final credits, you just know that the Godfather is special, and it refuses to let you go. The more you watch this film, the more you'll understand the plot and the characters, adding to a already great film. The Godfather has been copied many times, but never beaten. Soon, i'll get the Godfather: Part 2 and watch that, and see if its better, but until then, The Godfather remains No.1 on my top 10 list of all time.
Strong story ... professional actors .... Directed by smart ... Everything was in its peak...No matter how I look at this film is still attractive...He gives lessons on life and politics.....Although the film is old but it was attractive and new and never be out of date....While the film is long but not boring any moment of the film up...About coming to power, says. About a poor family that is powerful....About sacrificing the values to achieve the target on the first letter of his power....Strong story ... professional actors .... Directed by smart ...

I did not care for The Godfather. Did not care for The Godfather. Didn't like it. It insists upon itself, Lois. It insists upon itself.
One of the best ever movies i watched, wish to have same movies now a days
For years I ignored this movie thinking it might be too overrated and couldn't sit through such a long film . The movie is bit slow paced but has some fast paced sequences . Michael Corloene and Tom are my favorite characters . The climax was just amazing . Every actor did an amazing job . Must watch
The Godfather is a story of love, crime, death, and rise of the Corleones. It's a book painted into a movie so brilliantly that even the likes of Lord Of The Rings fall short. I cannot ever even imagine that there will be any movie as well made as the first two godfather movies.
I've never seen The Godfather from the beginning to the end until today. I was really impressed with how well it holds up, it is really well made and I enjoyed it a lot. This movie is timeless. I really liked seeing a young Al Pacino and Diane Keaton. It was like going back in time.


I love it deeply. Nothing to add. Plot bored me at first..because it was too much talking too less action. But it immadietly changed and i love it!!!

This movie is one of the best movie ever seen. Specially the act of Marlone Brando as a Don vito corleone.
What Can I Say ??? Is There a Word Who Realy Can Explain About This Greatest Masterpiece
Looking through old movies, I stumbled on this movie and what a find! It's absolutely perfect. I wonder why people don't quote it all the time. It's always nice when you find these little hidden gems.
An Amazing coverage of the Italian mafia Respect for the great cast Worth watching

"The Godfather" is truly one of THE greatest films in cinema ever. With the help of possibly one of the greatest casts, Francis Coppola's film is one that should not be missed. It all involves the rise and near fall of a mafia family. Many of the young talents have gone to other great roles. Among them are Al Pacino(who steals the whole film), Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and the late John Cazale. And of course, there's Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. He deserved the win for Best Actor, though it might have been a little dumb to refuse the Oscar. Pacino should have been the real winner for the role of Michael. With some of the greatest scenes ever this is a must see.
Amazing film / amazing cast / amazing writers / amazing production / amazing everything, 100% ahead of its time. Just breathtaking. Can't add anything that hasn't already been said about this picture.

A superb story, engaging and expertly crafted. The best actors cinema has to offer. Impressive directing moving us through their lives as if we are there. Topped off with one of the best film scores ever created. That is what this movie is, that is what allows us to completely suspend reality for two hours. Movies, films, cinema does not get any better.

One of the best movies so far, never gets bored. What a masterpiece... ! My love and respect for the actors brings me here after 43 years of the film release. Still I would say that even in 2015, this movie had a grip over me from start to end and left me with a hangover of its signature soundtrack.

That's what make it a timeless classic i guess.. !

The performances by all the actors are great. After you see the movie you have this feeling that "can a better movie be ever made ?" It is 100% craft. Best performance is that of Marlon Brando. You just cant ask for anything more.

A must watch before you die. :-)
This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my honest opinion. I unfortunately did not see the movie until recently, but I was absolutely swept away by the acting, the drama, and the story. I am Italian, so I felt a weird little bond in there as well. ;)

If you have not seen this movie, you haven't seen THE movie.

10/10 *****/***** A+
The Godfather is probably the most well crafted film ever made. No true fan of film will deny this piece of art. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino turn in amazing performances. James Caan and Robert Duvall are equally brilliant. The cinematography is among the best I've seen and the lighting is nearly perfect.

Watch this movie. Then watch it again.
Coppola, Brando, and Pacino all overcame early doubters to come up with terrific work. Brando is remembered most for this performance "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." Pacino's career took off following his portrayal of Michael, the war hero-turned-ruthless Mafia head. Coppola's brilliance is evident from the very beginning, with Vito entertaining the undertaker in the dimly lighted office. One of the finest films ever made.

I love everything about this movie, the acting, the imagery, the intrigue, the score...the only thing I have a problem with though is the title. Like can you really sleep at night? Like honestly REM sleep, knowing that you single-handedly stole the title of The Godfather from the demon of the north himself, Krampus. Adjacently, The Godfather 2? *Bleh* more like Jack I'm the Box Rises. Come up with something original next time, for God's sake.
This movie is the best movie ever for me ! He deserve the first place ! Story : "Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency." -This short story said everything about this movie, i liked all the personality, specially the hero of the movie. The Director he had know how to play with all the personalities and their roles. So great thank to him because he make a great movie. For the stars, "Unkonwn" he's my best actor all time ! 14 October 1994 is a special day, so always remember it ! :D I liked everything about the movie, even the Soundtracks. I think in our day we missed the movies such as The Shawshank Redemption, and the good father .. :(

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from every cast member is standalone, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family and carries the power a mafia head should possess. James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons, with polar ideology but equivalent love for the family. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time you hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get a Metascore of 100 and it is. It was one of the movies which defined the crime genre or to say the gangster genre.

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to a ruthless mafia boss.

Very well executed, "The Godfather" is one of the best films of the last three decades. It is directed by a great director: Francis Ford Coppola, and the cast is so great: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton (in her first starring role).

Winner of 3 Oscars and 5 Golden Globes, "The Godfather" is one of the best gangster flicks ever made. You do not remember the facts, but this film is a classic tale of a Mafia family: the Corleones. This is a true classic of the 1970s, you don't be fooled.

I also recommend: "The Godfather, Part II" and "The Godfather, Part III". Rent the entire "Godfather" trilogy in your local videostore.
This is been excellent and favorite movie all the time. Mr. Francis done really a great in the history of cinematography. First opening scene has revealed the outstanding performance of Mr. Marlon Brando. Al Pacino was absolutely amazing in his young age. This movie set the dimension of a underworld trend setter movie.

I didn't know movies could be this perfect. The acting, the story line, and the cinematography are superb. How much more can I write?
Thi movie has been in my wishlist for forever. Finally watched it and i wasnt dissapointed. Can't believe they made this masterpiece in 1970s! Loved the character development of Michael and how he takes over his father's role - but more dagerous and shrewd.

Francis Ford Coppola manages to execute one of the finest pieces of American cinema with the first of his three part saga, The Godfather.

From the dialogue to the acting, this film excels in painting a gritty, realistic depiction of the mobster hierarchy, with one of the greatest pieces of acting in cinematic history with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone.

This film has already stood the test of time and is deservedly ranked as one of the greatest films of all time. A true masterpiece.

I urge you if you have not yet checked out this film, what are you waiting for? It's a true hallmark of cinematic excellence and is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion.
This movie was well directed with great acting and character development. There were many plot twists that kept me guessing and made me want to sit through the lengthy film. Although, there were a few confusing jumps in time that took away from the overall experience of the film. This film set the mold of what many crime dramas would later follow. The film had great cinematography, using appropriate colors for each scene's tone. The film's score also resonated well with the scenes it was played in. The actors did a great job of immersing themselves in post-war mob culture while maintaining good chemistry with their co-stars. In conclusion, The Godfather is a film with excellent cinematography, acting, music, and plot.
The Godfather is my favorite film of all time. I like all three parts. I like the second one because I like Robert De Niro and I like the first one because Marlon Brando was greater than ever. I like them all because I like Al Pacino. The most ground-breaking about this film is the cinematography. I have to give it to Gordon Willis, he made it look like an epic which it is, the shading, the colors, everything. Mario Puzo is a great storyteller. Coppola is at his finest moments even though his original plans was to make Apocalypse Now'. He gave all his devotion to this picture and it shows. I like that he insisted on his cast, I don't know how it could have been without Al Pacino or Marlon Brando. Great dialogue. Great music, the best ever made for a film by the late great Nina Rota. It's simply amazing.
Glowing reviews are pretty much universal for The Godfather, and nothing I can say here could even significantly ad to the mountain of (well deserved)acclaim given to this masterpiece. The acting is superb: Brando is breathes subtle grace into the title role, Pacino gives an epic performance, Caan would never be this good again, nor would Talia Shire, Cassavettes is unflinching, and the constant analysis of every angle running behind the eyes of Robert Duval absolutely makes the film. Coppola, as always, is given to the grandiose, but here it fits like the proverbial glove, and he guides smoothly from ultimate tension (the "gun-in-the-toilet" scene leaves me dry-mouthed in fear even after the umpteenth viewing)to ultimate calm. The score is by now a classic, but like the entirety of this work, never satisfies merely on the memory of what it WAS but always fresh with what it still is. Overwhelming every time.
This is the best film made ever.

To learn and to understand how to make good movies The Godfather is the best movie ever that nobody filmed until now except Coppola. A perfect cinematic scenes, locations, art designs, wardrobe, plot, role acting, direction, art department, script, etc. This film has all the ingredients to know how to make a brilliant good film. Unfortunately knowing all of these parts too many people adding structural parts of the movies and making with all these ingredients didn't make a movie as Francis Ford Coppola made.
This movie don't deserve to be watched . The movie is very slow.

I'm not going to waste my time and my words on the plot or the summary of the film, but I'll write about the feelings that I proved watching "the Godfather". This film is a perfect movie and the cast is one of the best ever seen: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire... The majority of the actors are still appreciated and sought-after. The cinematography is wonderful; the soundtrack is very good (when I hear the trumpet at the real beginning I have the creep). I was really surprised when I read that "the Godfather" won only three Academy Awards: it should have won at least 10 of them. "The Godfather" is one of of the films that will be remembered even many years by now, and it's without doubts one of my favourite movies (with "the Godfather - part II and part III" and "Braveheart"). Don't miss it!
When I saw this movie ten years ago, I couldn't understand it.And now I think it's the best movie I ever seen. Marlon Brando is the real man.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production in the film, there is the wonderful music of the composer Nina Rota. An excellent melody, fallen in love with everyone and has long become a classic.
I thought this movie was a masterpiece is definitely better then part 2
Never thought I could enjoy a movie so much. Not into crime drama this just took my breath away!! A true masterpiece. That's what acting is all about. I wonder why I never got into it earlier.

A landmark classic of the gangster film genre. One of the lines in this movie that stood out to me was "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."Confident and relaxed.
The best movie of all time. It is the great beginning of the greatest film trilogy of all time. Truly mesmerizing with it's epic directing and stellar cast. It is definitely Hollywood (actually film-making as a whole) at its best. Loved the scenes and the atmosphere. It really deserves all the love it gets.
I watched it a few years ago and I didn't like it, I thought it was "cool" but nothing else. I thought it was boring and slow.

I then watched it a few years later, I recommend to watch it in the day or when your not tired, it is sooooo good!!!!!! I agree it's the best film of all time, shawshank coming very close. It may not be my favourite, but I agree it is the best. I prefer watching number 2, but number 1 is amazing.
I liked this film and all, but does anyone really think this film is better than Lord of the Rings? Come on! It's surprising how many people supposedly "love" this film, yet can only put up the defense that it was well acted. A few mumblings here and there do not good acting make. And the attention to detail argument? "It's so detailed - exactly as that era!" So what? Lord of the Rings brought to life a FANTASY land, far more challenging than 1940's New York.
This is probably the best movie ever made, well certainly the best that I have seen. One of the few movies that I find loses nothing in comparison to the book. Why can't they make more movies like this anymore? The acting is superb, the sets are great, the pace of the story is well set out, and the soundtrack is so right for the film.

Full marks to all who had anything to do with this creation.
Believe me, for those don't have attention spans, this is a movie that is worth trying to overcome that shortcoming. You won't be disappointed. I was lucky enough to see this recently at the new American Film Institute's Silver Theatre and Cultural Center where I work. Amazing. The DVD set has some great extra features. Also, look for the "ghostly figure" of Coppola during the funeral scene. *****/*****
Not for a reason. But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. Its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. A film who reminds more than presents. Values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. Short - a film who must see !
The Godfather movie has been reviewed from different perspectives and maybe this work of art is considered one of the masterpieces of cinema, but what has attracted my attention is the Godfather's business! An attractive idea with a business plan and a unique operational plan to create wealth and provide business security in innovative and new ways so that it can be inspired as a unique model for business development, how to manage members The group, keeping trade secrets, market development, audience analysis and how to deal with the law and interacting with society are only part of these issues that can be carefully considered, so I suggest you watch this movie from this angle.

I read all kinds of reviews that call this flick a 'masterpiece'. What kind of masterpiece? I have never seen a masterpiece played on TV every single weekend. It is always the B movies that are shown that much. And I love how 1 hour and 5 minutes of commercials are added on to make this a 4 hour movie. Repeat; a 4 hour movie!?! No, it's not a masterpiece and if it was, it would still not get 4 straight hours of my time.
The only defect of this movie is that it is perfect. The fact is that there's nothing more irritating in a movie than the unanimity. When someone hears that a movie is perfect, the best of history, etc... he/her creates expectations so high that no movie can ever fulfil. This movie is the case. Every single detail is crafted to perfection. Mario Puzo gave it the tense and realistic plot. Coppola gave it the dignity. Brando gave it the genius. Nino Rota gave it the passion...

Well, if you didn't see this movie, you are a very lucky person. You have the privilege of being able to see it for the first time and no experience can be stronger than the first one. But, first of all, forget all opinions about this movie. Don't create any expectation. Forget even this comment. And don't thank me for it. Just love "The Godfather".
Last Thanksgiving the WHOLE family was sitting at the table, eating, drinking. My cousin shouted in from the living room, "The Godfather's on," and it was, on regular TV complete with edits and commercials. Anyway, it's safe to say that every person in that house that day saw The Godfather a hundred times and the comments were, "My God, I've seen that so many times..." and within ten minutes everyone was in the living room, holding dishes in their hand, eating standing up, watching this movie that everyone knew inside out, everyone quoting from the movie as the actor's spoke, and so on. Trivia facts shared, general info on the movie, and EVERYONE glued to the picture. THAT is the sign of a great movie. If a movie can hold this kind of hypnotic magic, even after all these years, it has succeeded in the art of story-telling. Perhaps no other movie has this attraction like Godfather I. So, don't feel silly if you are seeing this movie for the tenth time (Or the hundredth time). It's always a winner.

The Godfather is without a doubt the Greatest Movie of our time and of anybody else's time. The brutally brilliant and passionate film is about the violent Mafia family, the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (Best Actor Academy Award Winner Marlon Brando) is passing on the family business to one of his sons-but which one? He decides to skip over the oldest son, the hotheaded Santino (Academy Award Nominee James Caan); He also decides to skip over cowardly Frederico (John Cazale); In the end he passes it down to youngest son, the intelligent Michael (Academy Award Nominee Al Pacino). This movie won the Academy Award for best picture in 1972 and deservedly so. Great performances by Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert Duvall. It deserves to be the IMDB's highest rated film and #3 on the American Film Institute's Best List. It should be number 1. On a scale of one to ten, this gets a 100.
Tried many times over and over nothing to do I can't make it trough the whole thing
Couldn't stay awake after 3rd time trying to watch it
These words can be heard throughout this movie. So with it can other lines that people love to quote. I guess you could say I love this movie for the way it was written. For that I would say you might as well be right. I mean this is a great film that has been said to be the "greatest film" ever made. I don't really know if I can support that. It has been a "great drama" but that is just that there are other genres out there you know. One should also be advised that it is four hours long. Given in this day and age who has four hours to sit down and watch a great film much anymore? You know also there was alot of killing and intent to injure others in this film which might make you wonder about today. If i s alright to have in movies but not alright to have in real life? For the love of the great man upstairs its not a kids movie either. It might as well be a movie that you go see after reading the books. Thats right theere is a series of books! I never knew that until I looked on here and saw who wrote the screenplay. May you rest in piece Mr. Puzo you will not be forgotten! Please watch this film give it a chance and remember this, there are books!


Well where to begin this film for me is the pinnacle of film. Its beautiful in every way. The music, acting, scenery, is virtually perfect. Marlon Brando for me gives the stand out performance in a fantastic cast. The film is captivating from start to finish. There really isn't enough praise I can give for this film, it really deserves its name in the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest. The film does a brilliant job at immersing you into the story of the Corleone family. You will struggle to find a film as engrossing and powerful as this one. I only wish films of today where made with such passion and brilliance. 10/10 a must watch for any film fan.
Goodfellow, bronx tail, casino, scarface, meanic to society, Boyz n the hood, fresh, and Donnie brosco are way better in my eyes. Honestly American gangster and legend is better than tgis movie. I will never understand why godfather is at the top of most these list. To me godfather, godfather 2, and the Irish man are the worst gangster movies. I've tried 8 times to watch this longest was hour boring. Please bring this movie down on list. Love every actor, director, others involved but just can't stand this series.
Although the 19th Century saw the creation of motion pictures, it wasn't until the 20th Century that films really took off. During times of hardships, audience flocked to their local cinemas to catch the latest flick, which invigorated Hollywood's movie studios to create imaginative & lavish films. This subsequently lead to the creation of some of the most innovative & influential films during the 20th Century. Among the list of 20th Century masterpieces is the critically-acclaimed film The Godfather (1972). Based on the novel by Mario Puzo & directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather breaks all norms of the film industry. A phenomenal cast, a powerful soundtrack and an enriching plot propels The Godfather into a high standard of films. By the end of the film, the audience would be persuaded to sympathize with the Corleone family & their "business". The Godfather should be on everyone's bucket list for "Movies to Watch Before You Die". Stop reading this and go watch it if you already haven't!
this film is amazing! it if exactly what i was expecting. it won 5 Oscars but i think it deserves more. Al Pacino is amazing in this film and so is Marlon Brando, James Caan,Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton they are all brilliant. this film is a masterpiece! it is violent witty and makes u think. i love Francis Ford Coppola and i think this is his best piece of work. i have seen this film 4 or 4 times now and i am still in love with it. i could watch it a thousand times and it would be better every time i saw it! this film deserves 10/10. it is a must see! if you haven't seen it o now and buy the trilogy or rent it! there are really no words to describe this film it is just so good! my favourite film of all time! this film is outstanding!
The Godfather is a very deep film and quite definatly is Oscar Material after recieving something like 7 Oscars. I will be viewing Part 2 tomorrow.

With a film like The Godfather its best to not know what its like and not now what beauty you are about to view. This is definatly Francis Ford Coppalla's best film.

ADAMS RATING- 100%
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
Probably one of the best films ever and easily one of the great films of the 70s. An all-star cast including Pacino, Brando, and Diane Keaton. Won best picture along with it's sequel. Also the best James Caan performance ever.

The film begins with the wedding of Godfather, Vito Corleone's daughter. Michael, played by Pacino, is home from the army to attend. James Caan plays Michael's hothead brother, Sonny. Sonny is involved in the family "business" which Mike wants no part of...at first. Double-crosses and surprising changes of heart make this a film every adult would enjoy.
If you're reading this, and you have seen the film, you know what I mean.

If you're reading this, and you have not seen the film, then stop reading my review, and any other review, and either watch the film, or just don't bother looking up anything directly related to the film ever again, because you're wasting your time.
Don't get me wrong, it was good, a pretty damn good film. But I read the book before I saw this film so I felt like the audience got skimped out on a lot of great and important details. And I'm sorry to say but Brando did not give The Don the justice he deserved. In the book The Don is beyond words. And Brando was simply excellent.

Overall though I really dug it, I'm excited to see part 2
The first 20 minutes of this film were slow. But then it took off and the plot got more and more interesting until some stuff happened and the main protagonist had to go to some foreign place. After that, it became a bore-fest filled with long drawn out scenes that added "little to nothing" to the plot. Like the guy's foreign wife... What was the Point of That!!? Fortunately, It ended in a pretty bad@$$ and brilliant manner. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this movie were pretty great. Still, that doesn't excuse the amount of filler and lack of character development for the characters that were actually important in the next film. That includes The protagonist too. (His Character Arc wasn't handled very efficiently. He was a lot better in the second movie.)
I was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created, it was no.1 in the IMDB chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted £12 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours!! if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre !!

Writing, Acting, Scenes all are perfect. Al Pacino - Mike, Marlon Brando - Don Corleone and James Caan - Sonny all did stunning performance.

Almost flawless movie, must watch!
Film that passes a cool feeling. Interesting colors and its focus is totally geared towards fixing the looks of whoever watches it. Congratulations to the director who led this production, congratulations to all the team that worked on this project, which marked the lives of millions of people, writer is also to be congratulated.
This is the standard for a good movie of which all other movies in history passed or future should be compared to.

Flawless in every category you can think of in which you would rate a movie. It just doesn't get any better than this.
The best movie ever! Watched it over 20 times and it is getting better and better every time! Read a book also.
As I wrote in the title, this movie is not just a mafia movie. It is a work of art that demonstrates the importance of respect and that action is more important than words. I don't even need to go into other topics. The acting is super, the cinematography is super, everything is super. And I want to mention one more thing. I think the flow of the movie, that is, the math of the entrance, development and result, and the sequences of the scenes are handled very well and harmoniously. God bless hands of eveyone who contributed it. Watch it, show it.
I cannot anything that hasn't already been said about this movie. It is a perfect movie and something has just clicked about it that made it a masterpiece. The acting is like we are watching real life documentaties,the speed is thrilling,the plot engaging. The character,once you love them,stay part of you. Watching The Godfather is'nt just a good experience,it is joining the Corleone Family.
This film was incredible. Unlike Goodfellas which was a juvenile and silly glorification of mobsters, Godfather was written to perfection and a masterpiece cinematically.
The great cast and the spectacular acting made this movie one of the best in the history. It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. "The Godfather" is my favorite film of all time. It is absolutely legendary. This film, redefined the gangster genre. "The Godfather" is a cinematic masterpiece. Everything about this movie is perfect. The performances are absolutely pristine. Marlon Brando gives the best performance of all time, in my opinion, as Don Vito Corleone. I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined.
Spectacular and nice movie. It is one of the best movies in all time. You have to watch it
This movie is so great, it has excellent acting, directing, screenplay, and the reality of the whole thing, the actors didn't look like actors the actors looked like real people.

However this film would be found at a movie store in under the Crime section, everybody knows that it is a film about family. one of the most dramatic films (that I liked) that I have ever seen and the best too

10/10
It is the best film I have seen to date. It is flawless in every way, acting, story, cinematography, direction, etc. I have seen Citizen Kane, but I must say, this one beats it. I can wait until it comes out on DVD. You know when a film is great, that is when no matter how many times you have seen it, if you happen to catch it on TV, you still watch it and are glued to your TV set, this is that film.
Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner.
Few movies have ever come close to this epic. It is the most intelligently and brilliantly woven piece of work that any man in the film industry has ever created. The genius of 'Coppola of the 70s' and the brilliance of the man are in perfect display here. Words escape me to describe this movie. Starting from the foundations of one of the greatest novels (kudos to Signor Puzo) it gains tremendous strength from the greatest acting, directing, producing and scriptwriting that one can come across.
I guess it's the fourth time I watch this movie and it seems to be getting better as I watch it again and again. Movies about the mafia are one of my favorites. I just loved The godfellas, Casino, Once Upon a Time in America but The godfather is diferent it not just about mafia. Its about a family completely involved in mafia. As some one have written here, the changes in Michael's ( Al Pacino ) personality are incredible. One of the best part is the baptism. Meanwhile Michael is at the church, his fellows show how will it be to deal with the Corleone's.

In a few words, watch it and also watch The godfather, part 2.

It's a pity but the third part of the trilogy isn't as good as the first ones.

a very exciting and interesting movie,including a lot of good acting specially Al Pacino as Michael Corleone ,which make you think about many things. a movie consist of cruel,clever,killer and of course lonely characters. a movie about violence,about mafia and about the life of us ,the true life of us.

The Godfather is a definitive example of cinematic perfection. There is nothing lacking from the film; acting, direction, cinematography; all perfect. And, like any good American classic, it becomes better with every viewing. Marlon Brando seems to get all the credit, but I believe Al Pacino delivered the film's greatest performance, as well as one of cinema's greatest. The Godfather is timeless, and will be treasured for decades to come.

Rating: 10
When I saw that The Godfather ranked number 1 on the IMDb top 250, ahead of The Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List, among others, I knew I had to see it. I rented it and watched it through a couple times. I'm having trouble figuring out why this is everyone's favorite.

It's a well made film, probably top 50 material, but it really wasn't a intoxicating, compelling, or moving experience for me. It isn't just a difference in taste, because I also saw The Godfather Part II, and that is one of the greatest films I've ever seen; top five material. I just never got into The Godfather's storyline. It's well made and all, just not the best, in my opinion.
Liked it a lot. being is a biy slow but it works i guess.
Really good. I liked it. beings a biy slow but it works.
I can understand why one might be bored by this film, it's three hours long and the majority of the American public can't wrap their puny minds around anything more complex than an episode of "Friends".

However, for anyone with an actual attention span (and i have ADD, so you should have a wider attention span than me), this film is a masterpiece. Sure it goes on for a while, but the story completely envelops you with the tension and the flavor of the tale. The symbolism is amazing as Michael Corleone's appearance slowly changes as his character changes. At the beginning of the movie, I didn't even recognize him as Al Pacino!

So, if you think that "Dude, Where's My Car?" is a marvel in filmmaking, then you might want to pass this one by. Otherwise, it's truly wonderful!


I think you prolly get it from my title that i love this movie. it is by far my favorite movie ever. i have seen this movie at least 50 times and i will watch it so many more.
God father is the greatest gangstar movie in ever life . The is movie make many directors favorite and inspiring one . God father of Don Colrene performance of the film top notch and his style of mannerisms such more stylish. Mike in the movie turn gangstar scene was many movie take copy of now a days . Because this film start this orgin. Colrene family is the cooperation of that family loves attached from all audience that duration was long but none of lacks that plus of that film. DON'T MISS IT THIS REALLY MASTER CLASS.
It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
I have seen this movie over 20 times and I still enjoy it. Best movie ever!
Well, after reading the other comments I can only conclude that I have nothing to add. This is the best movie ever made. I can recite what others have said, but I won't. Thank God he created everybody who has helped making this film. And to the one person on this world, who didn't like it: Sorry for you, you're life won't be complete.
In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece. It's a simple a mob story in which everybody is an antagonist; the story is not gripping, the characters are hard to care about, the camera work is adequate but not in any way remarkable, the list goes on. I don't think The Godfather is a bad movie, but in no way is it the best I've ever seen, or anywhere close.

The movie has been so hyped that I really was expecting to see the best movie all time when I watched it. What I saw was a decent flick with some very quotable moments, but in my mind the film has no singular or superior quality when compared to other great films. Monstrously overrated, but still a respectable movie.
The movie was so familiar in the beginning the scenes was natural and for a moment you would notice that you watching a video from the cellar of your grandpa pride and the story start to speed up in slow way till the half of it you won't believe that the start was not looks like the middst and the end , the acting and the story line was super class i would say it is the best movie ever.


I sometimes wish I was alive in 1972 so I could see The Godfather in theaters. Some of the best cinematography and editing was produced in this movie. It tells the story of the mafia from the inside. It was amazing how the movie made you admire Don Corleone even though he was essentially evil. During the movie, the audience really doesn't see much it can disapprove of. No women are involved in prostitution, no lives are being ended by compulsive gambling, and no theft rings. In fact, the only real person outside the mob who is corrupt is a police officer with a significant speaking role. Brando is great with many memorable and quotable lines, and Al Pacino's performance in comparison to Brando's shouldn't be ranked to much further behind. A great ensemble of a cast and supporting players. Well done!
Although I would not consider it the greatest movie ever, I would still give the Godfather a 10/10 and am willing to say that it is quite an amazing film. It is emotional, involving, and the performances are top-notch. A film that is good in every category, The Godfather is definitely better than it's sequels and my second favorite Coppola film (I liked Apocalypse Now a bit more).
CLASSIC CRIME MOVIE good actors better director the best crime story I've ever seen.
It definitely defined a new cinematic way to see into the characters and their growth. It also created a new ground for mob movies. The cast was also a key element to the movie Coppola did an amazing job directing. Brando's way of portraying Vito Corleone was spot on. Same with al Pacino.
What a masterpiece... ! My love and respect for the actors brings me here after 43 years of the film release. I think i am a terribly late entry into the fan club of this classic. Still I would say that even in 2015, this movie had a grip over me from start to end and left me with a hangover of its signature soundtrack.

That's what make it a timeless classic i guess.. !

The performances by all the actors are great. After you see the movie you have this feeling that "can a better movie be ever made ?" It is 100% craft. Best performance is that of Marlon Brando. You just cant ask for anything more.

A must watch before you die. :-)
The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinematography and one of the greatest adaptations of a novel in movie history,
Perhaps no other film comes so close to perfectly depicting the lifestyle of the early mafia. It's flawless in it's execution, takes its time to let the story unfold properly, then builds the tension to maximum effect and allows the viewer to feel what that lifestyle must feel like when it all comes crashing down. So many amazing quotes, so many amazing images. Perhaps surpassed only by installment 2 (in this critic's eyes), there aren't many movies better made.
Really good concept,good acting pro actor and the directing magnificent it is actually really cool for people who love action movies and this is NOT for kids so if your going to watch this tell your son/daughter go sleep XD
The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.
The remarkable movie was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out. "The Godfather" himself is the central character in the drama.

This film is so flawless, I don't even feel worthy of reviewing it. There is nothing wrong with this film. It is perfect in every aspect. The only 10 I know of, and because of it, I'll keep watching for more.

10/10
One of the best if not even the best movie about mafia (Along with part I and part II).

A Oscar awarded movie,it might be old (1972) but I still recommend it to everybody.

The actors Marlon Brando and Al Pacino will be for ever remembered for their part in this movie as Don Vito Corleone (Godfather) and Michael Corleone (his son that eventually became Godfather)

Respect for the Writer , Director of the movie , Actors and everybody else that was on the set , they did a amazing job that has marked everybody that saw the Godfather series. Well done !

This movie has to be seen at least once in a lifetime !

Do not miss this movie !
The Godfather is a timeless Dime that isn't afraid of slow pacing storytelling or trying something new (1972). Thoughtful Camera work and an epic tale leave many including myself glued to the screen as every scene is articulated in such a way that screams perfection. Casting Crew hit the goldmine with this one as Brando, Pacino, and James Caan Should be an illegal combination. No more should be said except perfection.


This movie is the best movie ever made. I find it hard to believe that there are some people who actually gave this movie a 1. This movie is fiction yes, but the characters are based on actuall people and mobsters. Can you spot the one based on Frank Sinatra? Of course you can. This movie has remained number one on many critics (both professional and not) for one reason. It is simply the best. If this movie doesn't grab you and hold onto you I don't know what would.

A very well known classic film. The story is what keeps me coming back to this. A mafia boss' son that has managed to stay separate from the family and their dealings, only to gradually be drawn back in as his father's life comes under threat. The transition of this early conflict of the main character is the main force behind this film. Pacino's performance is stand out as one of the best performances of all time. That would be good on its own but there's so much more to offer. All the characters are well fleshed out and Coppola's direction of slowly letting the story unravel whilst giving the actors time and space to portray their characters is genius. Highly recommended.
If you are a big fan of the HBO TV series the Sopranos, you should check out this movie. It's not quite the same, the Godfather has more of a straight forward plot, with out the clever twist and turns and various subplot of the Sopranos, but it's still pretty good. Marlon Brando basically play the Tony Soprano part and I think he's definitely as good as James Gandolfini. Al Pancio's good in it, too. This movies is really an under-rated gem, but you should be able to find it at most larger video stores. You should rent this one for sure. With that being said, it has a few problems, there's no nudity to speak of in this movie like there is on the Sopranos and while there is a beheading of a horse you don't get to see so much, like when Tony and Christopher cut off Ralphie's head. Oh, check out the two sequels, they're both alright, too!

8 out of 9 stars
Perfect. That is the only word that can truly describe this epic. Truly one of the few films that deserved a Best Picture oscar. Coppola and Puzo have given us a story that is at a shakesperean level. Honor, Family, Loyalty, these are what is important to these characters and you see it. The characters are so real that you communicate with them. I found myself talking to them and yelling at them. You feel for these people. Truly this is more than a movie, this more than a film, this is the epitome of what all movies should be.
Some memorable sequences, in particular a string of assassinations intercut with the family at church, but too many overly long scenes. To me the film seems disjointed, and is let down by poor central performances (yes poor) by Brando (hammy), Pacino (stiff) and Keaton (invisible).

The Conversation, which Coppola directed a couple of years later, is a better film, with a brilliant performance from Hackman. But even that takes an hour to get moving.
While this isn't my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in my top 10. I've probably seen this movie a half dozen times, but I recently watched it again for the first time in about 15 years. If you haven't seen it lately, it's worth watching again.

Amazing film it is faultless. Brilliantly cast, great story, beautiful soundtrack I can't praise the film enough. A must see!
This is number one movie in the world! this should be top of 250!
I love this movie but hate me if you will the second is better. Just facts!
A timeless masterpiece. A truly awe inspiring piece of cinema. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Very well directed with dazzling cinematography. Acting was superb and the script was flawless.

I'd recommend this film to anyone, especially those who enjoy Scorsese's work with mobs like Goodfellas and Casino. The film is so enthralling you can not believe it came out in 1972. The camera work and direction of Capolla was truly amazing.

It has such memorable and quotable lines. And another mention of the acting, because Pacino was unbelievable and so convincing as Michael. A defiant masterpiece, everyone should see this movie, at least once.
Why oh why is this 'the second best movie ever' according to imdb? Do we really need to sit through 2,5 hours of nothing to see for just a little bit of action in the last 10 minutes? Gangster movies can be entertaining, just ask Scorsese. This was nearly 3 hours of trying to keep awake just because of the high rating. Thanks but no thanks. Hopefully the second one will be better but I have my doubts after seeing this one.
A cinematic masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppola. One of the greatest movies ever made. Marlon Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: realistic anti-hero, villain with million of verges. It's also story about how one good man (war hero) become a genius of a criminal world. Every scene was directed with the soul. Combined with Part II. In this movie perfect everything: perfect characters, adapted screenplay, and original soundtrack. Film about relationship between family members, loyalty, honor in life of gangsters and revenge. The Godfather did for gangster movies what Alfred Hitchcock did for Thriller (Suspense) genre.
One of the Greatest movies I have ever seen! There is like, nothing wrong with it. I loved everything with The Godfather! The acting, the directing, the script, the score, the cinematography etc. And the line "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" is really famous today. RIP Marlon Brando, you were an excellent actor. The Supporting cast, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan are excellent. I know I am using the word excellent in this review, but its because everything in this movie is excellent. Propably the greatest gangster picture I have ever seen. The Godfather Part II and III were also excellent, but I think the first film was the best. 9/10.
I'm personally not that into gangster or mafia movies, I'm one of the rare people you will meet to tell you that Goodfellas is kinda overrated, and far from Scorsese's best film. There are however a few exceptions to that, and on the very top of that list, is Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.

This movie is pretty much flawless. The cinematography is fantastic, the music is beautiful and fits with the italian mafia theme perfectly, the performances from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in particular are among the greatest ever captured on film, and the film received 9 Academy Award nominations with 3 wins, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Brando.

10/10 across the board for me, and may be the undisputedly greatest film of all time.
This movie is truly a masterpiece. It is nearly flawless, and was remarkably realistic. No need for mob stereotypes ..... Just a conservative portrayal of a family with deep roots. Remarkable, and a treat to watch over again. It's too bad Brando was a bit of a flake, because he is probably the best actor that ever lived. Every character is complex, but I think my favourite must be Sonny. A hot headed son who is expected to take the reigns of the family one day, in spite of older brother Fredo. I was a kid when it came out but I would love to see it on the big screen. I also find the ages of the actors interesting... Pacino and Caan were very close in age despite Caan as being portrayed as years older. Duvall is actually considerably older than those two. And Abe Vagota is the oldest living cast member.
At that time, the rhythm of the movie was too far from the present, and the climax was not prominent. It seems to be outdated now. At that time, it was a good movie, but it was ordinary or even worse than the current movie.
What a beautiful plot and story and role played by the actors. That's absolutely brilliant.

With the complete and total abscence of excessive computer effects, Godfather is impeccable on storyline, character development, and acting. No excessive violence. No excessive swearing. Simple how every movie should be.
Great Movie of all time very Fabulous acting dialogues. Awesome best crime drama i loved it.....
A film with a solid structure that is still relevant to contemporary audiences.
A lesson to the movie creators and movie goers. Really fantastic work of all 28 CRAFTS which are engaged perfectly and with exact timing. After years even now the movie is an text book to the movie makers. Just this is a wonder.



Although this is a great movie, I still think Coppola's sequel "The Godfather Part II" is much better.
By far, the best movie that I have ever seen (and that's saying a lot)... The acting, the story, the action, the family, everything!!!

Al Pacino gives us the best performance the screen has ever seen... Watching his transformation through the three films is simply amazing... Brando, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Cazale are all outstanding as well...

The Best... period...
This movie is excellent. The only reason it's not my favorite movie is it's not that pleasant to watch. In my opinion, The Godfather, Part II ALMOST matches this. What puts Part I over the top for me is Marlon Brando. He is unbelievable. Also, Al Pacino's performance was Oscar worthy (correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think he won). His transformation was unforgettable. Overall, see this and the sequel, but skip part III.
The 'Godfather' is certainly a very good movie and i enjoyed it very much. But in my humble opinion there are many movies that are better than this one and its sequels.It is certainly overrated because people tend to concentrate too much on american films here. The acting of Marlon Brando is very good and makes this film something special.But anyway, at some point i got a feeling of watching some kind of soap opera because except for Brando's part the rest of the characters remain relatively flat. The music to this film is very good and contributed much to its fame. All in all i would be prepared to say it is among the best American films of the 70's.
The godfather is considered a classic, i now know why it is one of the most poetic movies i have seen. From the beautiful wedding scenes at the beginning to the unforgettable ending it is a lesson in film making. The story although very slow, is very good. The film does go on for a bit (about 3 hours) it can be watched in two sittings if you want to. The only gripe i have about this film is that it could be considered as a two part mini drama on TV (although a very very good one). The acting is outstanding Marlon Brando makes one of the most memorable characters ever and a young Al Pachino is also very good.

Over all though excellent ill give it a score of

8/10 (and a proud place in my film colection)
I see this movie at least 1 per month, and i love everything about it. The actors could not be chosen better, Marlon Brando made his best presentation. The Godfather raise Al Pacino and Robert Duvall to glory. It is the cinema masterpiece.
Adapted by the book with the same written by "Mario Puzo" comes "The Godfather which is literally acclaimed by the critics as the best movie of all time. It has everything: Drama, Action, Thriller, Mystery and perfect acting. It is the one movie that no one dares to criticize or hate. With stars like Marlon Brando, Al Pacio, Robert Duvall it shows you the quality of the movie at the first minutes of it even without even seeing the movie. I have seen "The Godfather" 10 to 12 times so far and i don't regret it a bit. Nobody does. If you haven't seen the movie yet(which is rare and unfortunate) you should. You will love it and want to watch it over and over again.
I have heard people talk about how this is the best movie ever, and I can't join the Argument because I have not yet seen the Film.

Today, I decided to see what all the fuss is about. It was a Film so good that I cannot stop thinking about how good it is.

I am most impressed with its development of Michael. How he was not even an understudy to his brother but yet became the head of the table. His keen observation and probably his Military skill helped him.

Don Vito Corleone is a smart, cautious, and patient man. He only strikes when necessary. He tries to avoid trouble at all costs. And he knows his time is up. And how he hands over power to his son.
Fabulous movie. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.
Everything from the acting, directing, and writing of this movie is perfect. There isn't a single bad line of dialogue. There isn't a single poor shot in the movie. I could go on and on about it but this movie really is perfect. The story is classic and simple, leaving it easy and fun to follow. Every scene moves the plot forward to the next scene. There are so many great moments in the movie that're still studied by young filmmakers today. The only weak point of the movie is the character arc of Michael Corleone, while he is a well written character I feel like it's nothing we haven't seen before in a film. Overall there isn't a single thing wrong with the film and it's one of the best movies ever made.

If you haven't watched it, then you're missing something. Never have I ever felt like a movie could feel so real. Amazing in every way.

Just watch it!
This is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie is golden. Highly recommend.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
What can I say other than this is the greatest film ever made. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is exquisite. The screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo is very rich in detail. The best thing about the movie however is the cast. Whoever was casting director on this film did a fantastic job. I mean, Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Keaton, Cazale...they all deserved one big Oscar. 10/10
It's such an iconic piece of cinema - no matter how many times I catch this on TV, I never change the channel. It's such a mythic study of power. Coppola never needed to make another film, but fortunately he did, creating three more classics within the same decade - The Godfather Part II, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. The Godfather is just timeless, with such pitch perfect performances, cinematography, direction, editing, music, production design, sound design... the list goes on. This film and its sequel is the high water mark of American cinema in the latter half of the 20th century,
The story is enough of an attraction but looking back at this years after first watch it in the Cinema Al Pacino's performance can be seen for the brilliant actor he is.
This is a film that contains almost all of the factors that a perfect film should have. Great themes, plot that hooks you from the beginning, little twist and details that make you love the film, fantastic cinematography and designing, good costumes, amazing character development, and of course the greatest cast any film has seen (Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...)
It's a fairly decent gangster film. If that's your sort of thing, I can see why you'd rate it highly, but otherwise it's fairly forgettable. I wouldn't have bothered with a review if I didn't think it's rating and acclaim were so misplaced.

The acting was good, and there are some memorable scenes, but spaced out far too much - 3 hours is a very long time for a film with such an aimless and meandering plot. There are lots of story threads introduced throughout the film, but none of them really stuck with for long enough to get invested in the characters or what was happening.
As what Marlon Brando says "kiss my hand, call me your Godfather for justice...and friendship. This film is incredible, Francis's directing is justice to the film history. Marlon Brando is incredibly strong in his character. The blood is too graphic. The Score is beautifully mastered to the picture. God bless for "The Godfather" Especially, Al Pacino's acting is superb.

A mistake to this film...the deaths, the irony of the characters. Theme is good, but not great. Redemption, Trust, and Family. This Italian Mafia takes over New York and the rest of Hollywood. I love this film because of the death of James Caan's character, Sonny. Wow, the deaths in this film. There is one death, two deaths, even many deaths in the film that make the film incredible.
Each time I watch this I fall deeper in love. Brilliant.
Maybe it's Marlon Brando. Maybe it's the score, cinematography, or the memorable characters, but there's just something about the Godfather that sticks with you. It's one of those movies that gets loved more and more as time goes on. It's one of those movie's you wish you could watch again for the first time. It's a movie in everyone top ten. It's a movie I'll be showing my kids. The Godfathers a journey of a reluctant son becoming the thing he swore he'd never become. A businessman, a killer, a Criminal. The Godfather is, without a doubt, one of the most well crafted cinematic masterpieces of all time.
I've just recently seen The Godfather and it's like eating gum with Italian flavors! There so much culture booming from here to there the wedding party is perfect start and so is the line of daughter being taken advantage as sad as that line was. The crime in this film is for most a epic movie there's guns murder and love. The scene where the narcotics team are getting messed up and they've chose to hurt each other is amazing seeing this people say there not gonna be like the dad and slowly turn evil is something of a masterpiece. This is a great film a master piece.
This has been a favorite for years. Never boring, always excellent, always new. No matter how many times I've watch this, it entertains.
you will learn a lot from this movie about life, love, revenge, growing up, power, friendship & the most important of course Family :)) the relationship between Micheal and his father it's alone need another movie.. how Micheal character complicity changed but he still the same, what could revenge and anger achieved when they exits in smart person.

-It's not personal, it's just business. -I don't like violence, i'm businessman blood is a big expense. -Revenge is a dish best served cold -i'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse -Never hate your enemies, it effect your judgment. -Great men not born great, they grow great. the quotes in this film are endless..

it's a life guide movie not just another Hollywood movie.
It can be boldly said that this film is one of the eternal masterpieces of world cinema. A wonderful acting team with a great director, writer and cinematographer who forces us to see this film to the end. This atmosphere is very special and wonderful and it gives us a mafia feeling.
After watching this film I finally understood what a good actor really was. Pacino is spectacular and Brando is brilliant, all round excellent film.

The plot works very well and is complex and simple depending on how much depth you want to put in it.

Sadly quite a few people's attitude to the film is negative, they are missing out.

The second godfather is excellent as well but the third is not really worth the effort.

Pacino is worth seeing in most of his films, try Dog Day Afternoon, very good :-P
The acting, direction, camerawork, dialogue, sets even; everything in this film is iconic. The soundtrack is one of my favorites. I've always loved the simplicity we get to see at certain points in the film. The character developments are just flawless, not just Michael, every character feels changed till the end of the film. It's just the perfect film.
What more is there to say. The Godfather is the greatest film ever made. A 10 out of 10 rating just does not do it justice, there should be an 11 rating reserved just for films like this. The storyline is gripping from start to finish. The acting in this film is beyond brilliant, and there are so many classic scenes. In short it is more than a must see film. It is a fantastic synthesis of the cruel mafia underworld, and the story of the noble family behind it. What would I say to someone thinking of watching this? If you could only watch one other film before you die, then you would have to chose this one.It is the Perfect Movie.
This movie blows your mind away with its great cast. This movie is full of emotions and ups and downs. It depicts a father that has the will to do anything to keep his family safe and happy at any cost. It also shows how a man can be so cruel.

It would be easy to name a solid handful of decent Mafia movies but this is without doubt the Godfather of them all, A family tree through the ages vying for control of the crime family network. This epic story will span over a trilogy from the turn of the century to the late 70s and centres in on Michael Corleone the unsuspecting heir to a legacy left vacant by Vito Corleone The Godfather. Enemies , friends , family , authorities , who can you trust in a cesspool of corruption , deceit , murder and politics , Michaels path is laid out for him and its obvious the apron strings cant be cut no matter his reluctance no matter his refusal , when it comes to family you need to take your place at the table especially this family. World class Script , Direction , and Acting , BRANDO , PACINO & DENIRO swim in these rolls as the heads of the Corleone crime family and a legacy is born with an untouched masterpiece...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world that's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie.
People always ask me this question why do you like "The Godfather". I always tell them, you have to see it to know it.

Vito Corleone the Godfathaer is fair, just. He smuggles gold but he won't deal in drugs and prostitution rackets because that's "infamita". He won't hesitate to kill a few Tattagilas because the world doesn't need them. He is angry with the establishment but that won't make him kill innocent people.

The Godfather stays true to Mario Puzo's book. The dialogues are the same as well.

What makes The Godfather special is that it's not a gangster film but a film about people who happen to be gangsters. At the end of the film you'd feel to take Coppola's hand and call him the Godfather.
Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.
Francis Ford Coppolla has indeed done an excellent job of illustrating an Italian mafia family in the US, all the extremes they go through etc. The casting was also excellent and Marlon Brando/Al Pacino undoubtedly deserved the Oscars. The picturization was also well done, along with the background music. If you have read the book by Mario Puzzo, you will surely notice some change in the story towards the end. I suppose the change was to enable the production of Godfather II and III, which wereZ also good.
Godfather is a groundbreaking and truly original piece of legendary film. With a cast of Oscar winners and awesome script, this film feels like you have been implanted into the scene of a real environment. Life like acting with emotive vibrations, grips you from the offset, with a compelling story that seems to get more intense and exciting as the film rolls on. This film will never get old and I have the lost the count how many times I have watched the famous trilogy. Having owned this on Video, DVD and now Bluray, I can honestly say this will be in my collection for all time. True classic.

Peace and Blessings


This movie has a lot of history. I used to describe it as one of the best movies ever. This was when I still was a boy and mafia-movies were so exciting. Don't get me wrong, 'The Godfather' is still an amazing excitement to watch and if I have time I still do watch it. But with this movie it is as it is with so many things in life. Time shows that it is only a thing, or as it is in this case, a movie. Therefore I recommend to anybody who hasn't watched 'The Godfather' already: don't hesitate any longer. Watch it now! It is a beautiful story, great acting, and definitely a movie you won't forget. But for those who have seen this film, maybe many times already...don't discard it, I suppose it has become part of your own history. Enjoy talking about it, love watching it, and don't waste it by naming it the 'Best movie ever'.
Francis Ford Coppola's legendary masterpiece about the Corleone Family is a must to every moviegoer. Although everybody knows it is considered one of the best films of all time, only watching can one understand the true power of this picture. Coppola succeeded in humanizing the mafia, in a way that his main character, the ruthless Vito Corleone, became one of the most beloved icons in movie history. Under his belt, Coppola had one of the best casts ever to appear together on screen. In the main role is the legendary Marlon Brando in what is probably his best performance ever. Alongside him you see the brilliant Al Pacino in his first major role, the amazing Robert Duvall and the great James Caan. The supporting cast also counts on Diane Keaton, John Cazale and Talia Shire. Thus begin the best movie franchise of all time. Sit back and watch this powerful film.
This is Coppola's crowning jewel, if not the 20th Century's. The story follows the legacy of the Corleone Family, one of the Five Families of New York in the 1940's. With accuracy in the time period and perfect accents, the cast of All Stars take over the screen with grace. A young Al Pacino heads the cast as an innocent and yet murderous Michael Corleone. Robert Duvall also gives the performance of his life as the Irish American Tom Hagen. And of course, Marlon Brando steals the scene as Don Corleone. The story tells a tale of family, trust, honor, and respect. Even though the characters are murderers and thieves, they are also fathers, sons, and husbands. This is a must-see for any movie goer. You have not seen American cinema until you have seen "The Godfather."
There have been many great films made. Alien, Life of Brian, Scarface. But only a select few don't bow down to this classic. There is a reason for this. It has a skilled production team. Acting-Some of the best acting I've ever seen. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the world's best two actors. Script-Well written, no weak lines. Score-haunting and desperate, fits the tone of the film. I could go on and on. This film is an absolute classic. Do yourself a favour and watch. Even if you don't like gangster films, this is an essential watch. Sorry if this review is short, but I don't see how endless words can portray how expert this is. Well made to an extent few films have reached or even beaten the level of. This has stood the test of time.

This film is absolutely Brilliant in EVERY respect!! Characterization, Story, Plot, Script, Cinematography, Acting. The Godfather is a True cinematic Masterpiece. Bravo!If there are any holes, weaknesses or inconsistencies, I have yet to discover them. I've watched it at least 8-10 times and it blows me away every single viewing. GF2 was excellent, but not nearly as tightly written, several holes in the story that simply don't add it, but still a great film in it's own right. GF3 - very underrated indeed.
this film, is the best film I ever seen out of hundreds of movies. every other month I feel that I need to watch the first part or the second part of the series of the God father again and again. Which they are the best. even they were considered 70s but they still one of the best movies have ever produced and have been filmed to the humanity ! story of power and energy, family, reality of American History. also no one can ignore the music and themes of this films that takes to different world or different planet. the Italian accent also is adding a lot of art to the movie picture. with one word describing this film it is a story of dreams life !
It insists upon itself, to quote Chris Griffin. It's a Family Guy reference! Do you get it? Pretty clever, huh?

Like this film (upper-crust word for "movie") needs another fantastic review from someone who knows little about FILM. Flawless acting, characterization, pacing, writing - it has it all. It's a school book for what a movie (or film, AND film, for that matter) should be. Like a Shakespearean drama it amuses the full range of its audience - the cheap seats get the tawdry mob thriller while the box seats get the upscale shine of an avowed masterpiece. I'm just trying to use the required number of characters, and now I have!
This is the closest film of being perfect out of all of the films. Great story and a fantastic directing, on top of that an amazing cast. This film never disappoints anybody. A true masterpiece that captivates the viewer.




This is not only the great movie about mob but it is the best movie ever considered in many charts. The acting roles of Brando and Al Pacino are something unbelievable. The story is great exciting intense and famous catch phrases make this movie unique and remembered in the history of cinema.
Probably the best Motion Picture of all Time.What else can I say. I have read the novel and that was really great too, Francis Ford Coppola was really good in editing from the book to the screen. The Acting and the Screenplay was amazing which are probably the most important thing in movies. Nino Rota's Musical score was awesome it fitted in so well with each scene and brought it the right feeling to it. The story moved from one emotion to another in such a perfect way, you will find Suspense and Passion Power and Hatred in a way that will change the way you watch movies.The Godfather Part II was as good as this one. There is no other Motion Picture that takes you in an unforgettable story of Crime, Love, Hate and Power like The Godfather.
Flawless.. and one of the greatest films ever made
1 bad ass film all i can say abount it all most see it its great
I mostly love the first part! I can easily say the best movie ever made. Actors are amazing, the writing is brilliant 10/10! 100% Worth watching
Excellent movie, definitely check it out! One of my all time favourite movies!
This movie is absolutely worth watching. I loved everything about it. Godfather and his son Michael made this movie so cool.
An iconic movie.

It was based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel.
This movie is Epic. i never tired no matter howmany i see this.
This is start & end of the Cinema This is best film of Marlon Brando Al Pacino!

Words are hard to find, to describe my love of this film. Every time I view this film I still find something to marvel at... something that I had missed on previous viewings. I too, believe that this is a flawless film. On one viewing, I was struck by the use of lighting in the film, how contrasting the lighting was. The use of light and dark, so beautifully used throughout the film, to me, symbolised the light and dark of these characters, and the world in which they lived. I love the portrayals of Mario Puzo's characters... Marlon Brando was superb.I loved watching Michael Corleone change from a naive young war-hero to a ruthless mafia godfather. I loved each of the characters in this film. That is one of the things that I like best about this film... that these ruthless men worked their way into my heart, casting away any judgement I would usually hold against people who do the hideous crimes that these men saw as merely work and necessary protection for their beloved family. I love their self-righteousness and even their lack of conscience. I am passionate about this film ... every damn aspect of it!!!
Godfather was truly magnificient in all aspects..Marlon Brando was simply superb, his most touching dialogue 'Keep your friends close and enemies closer' still echoes into my ears when I come across the name Godfather! Not forgetting Al Pacino, who played Brando's son, was just too good to watch..All in all, a GREAT CRIME MOVIE EVER!!!
Bad movie In The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppla is either a bad director or a hypocrite. The audience cheers for the Corleones, despite all Coppola points to to try to prove he disapproves of the mafia. Can Al Pacino portray an ordinary American? Brando nearly sinks Part I with his Hey! Look at me! Performance. He was never an ensemble actor.
Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.
Coppola's intense films are the stuff of legend and the sweeping drama of the Corleone family that was begun in this film is no exception. The script is well written by Coppola and Puzo, who wrote the book, the acting is superb, and the little things like the lighting and the music add to the intensity and the drama of this film. Al Pacino in pretty much his first role is superb as the straight war hero son of the Corleone Family who gets drawn into the "business" when his father is attacked. Brando and Caan as well as Robert Duvall also deliver great performances. The scene that sticks with you like the Baptism when Michael is having his enemies killed and its flashing back and forth between murders and the Catholic Baptism in Latin owing to the pre Vatican II setting is superb. An excellent film well deserving of being ranked 3rd all time by the AFI. The lighting is a superbly done job of being dark but light illuminating certain things much like a painting from the Dutch Master Rembrandt. All due respect to Blake Edwards but this movie is a "10"
This is a movie where everything seemed to come together. Great cast. Film score on point. The sets are very well done. The story is compelling. A truly iconic film!
"The Godfather" is, in my opinion, the best gangster movie ever created. I like this movie for its superior directing and excellent storytelling. This movie shows us that even gangsters are born human beings. They face victory and defeat about as much as any other group of people. Despite its graphic intensity, I found myself paying very close attention to the emotions of the main family. I'd say that it is a step above "The Untouchables". Anyone interested in major film classics should see the original "Godfather" at least one time.

... when so many people complain about an all-time classic like "The Godfather" being too long and slow. I'm a firm believer that a movie needs to be as long as the story allows; we don't need to make a SNL skit into a 90-minute movie, and we don't need to cut a novelized classic down to placate the dwindling attention span of the audience. What scenes would you cut, honestly? What is not needed in this movie? Would you shorten the long shot of Michael as he admits that the Turk needs to be killed? Maybe cut out the Don's death scene, as it obviously slows down the movie? Honestly, I don't understand it...
A film better then anything Hollywood has ever produced. The critics adore Citizen Kane (a good film, undoubtably) but it doesn't have the deep qualities of the Godfather, it is a one man show (which can be good, Taxi Driver, but still...) but in the Godfather the star, Brando, I feel is a supporting character. Excellent as he is in the role, he still doesn't match the pace and glory of the next generation of Mafia hoods he is tutoring as the role of Don Corleone. The true gem of the bunch is obviously Pacino who controls the screen with a performance that he has never bettered in the 28 years since, but don't forget the arrogant Sonny (James Caan), the in control Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and my personal favorite, the runt of the litter Fredo, expertly executed by the late John Cazale.

All in all a story of love, power and above all, family.
With many classic moments, amazing performances, a gripping narrative, as well as incredibly assured direction by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is truly unmissable. Any self respecting film fan who has not seen this film should rectify that without delay.

My all-time favorite movie. No crime drama has ever matched this film or its sequel's intricacy or thoughtfulness. This movie portrayed the Mafia in a new light, examining it as nothing more or less than families with the deepest love for and loyalty to each other. Not to mention all the actors' amazing performances, Coppola's masterful direction, and his and Puzo's faithful adaptation of the book.
This film is a masterpiece in every way. The score is perfect. The cast's preformence in the film was perfect. The cinematography was perfect. Overall it's a masterpeice
When you haven't watched it yet, you have lost the control of your life. It's a must-see, cause its so good.
It's difficult watching old films retrospectively and understand why they are so acclaimed. But, The Godfather lives up to the hype. The dialogues are outstanding. The story is captivating. And the performances are extraordinary. Michael Corleone's transformation is quite riveting. Al Pacino was wonderful. Marlon Brando is also amazing as Don Corleone. The film was slow in some aspects but overall it was an incredible film.
The best movie of Godfather's series, Marlon Brando's performance is perfect. The Godfather is a masterpiece of epic proportions.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

This is simply one of the best movies ever! Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors ever lived and the movie has a great bonus!-Al Pacino!

Robert Duvall and James Caan give their best and those actors make this movie to a masterpiece. The plot is very interesting and Francis Coppola did a great job. There are many masterpieces like Citizen Kane, A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Forget American Beauty. The best films are already done, there won`t be a better movie.

This movie is Ford Coppola at his iconic, captivating and world building best. Vito Corleone is such an intriguing and interesting character to see on screen, which is just one of the many reasons that this movie's 2h 57m runtime flies by.
From the very first moment you just dive into the deep and dark world of the mafia and you just have to admire the acting of Marlon Brando from the very first scene. Although some might be scared to see the length of the movie, but every minute is worth watching. you never feel bored; not for a second. On the other hand you enjoy every second of it. The Al pacino part doesnt really come out in this part. this one is more of a Marlon Brando show. You feel the drama, tragedy, thrill, romace, action, violence all at the same time. truly a masterpiece movie made from a masterpiece epic of a book. No movie fan should miss it.
Rest in peace, godfather. It's just, I have to correct you. Even though you don't spend much time with your family, you're still a real man. Because your role has taught countless boys to become men. For this reason alone, I will always respect you.
As the reviews show! This movie truly is a gem! Al Pacino took it to another level!

I can't say enough about this film. It is simply the best example of what can be achieved through the art of cinema. It's visually stunning, literate and totally engrossing. It gave us the finest Pacino performance of his career, no small feat. And gave us Brando unlike I've ever seen him before. You can't take your eyes off him. His performance is stunning. Every other role is also perfectly cast. Look for James Caan to ignite the screen. I watch this film at least once a year so I can remember what a first rate film is supposed to be like.
It is the best movie that can exist on the face of the earth, on the day that another one is made as I hope to be alive even, but until now there is no one who wins
One of the best films of all time, Am happy watched it. Good acting
I've read the book.....I've seen the movie, and, trust me, I've been more entertained by stories before and since. What makes this movie the classic that it is is the "life" brought to the screen by this group of fine actors. After seeing the film, I don't think that anyone could imagine Don Vito Corleone being played by anyone other than Marlon Brando, who is possibly the greatest actor in film history. Same with Al Pacino in the role on Michael. The cold hearted and hot headed bastard that is Michael could not have been portrayed better by any other actor. James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan....these men were born to play these parts. Even Talia Shire, who I really don't care for much as an actress, delivers one hell of a stellar performance. Diane Keaton, too. It's performances like these that you only see once in a lifetime. These actors and actresses create real lives for Mario Puzo's characters, each with such distinct personality that after watching the film, I refer to the characters by their first names, almost as if I know them. The characters are portrayed so well that one could create a mock situation in ones head and accurately determine how a specific character would respond to it. Don't get me wrong, I love the story line here, but it's acting which makes this film a classic.
A movie that I can watch a hundred times and not get bored.
without question the greatest movie ever made every actor/actress in this movie is fantastic James Caan is a master with his part. Talia shire is a great actress and she proves it here there is not enough awards to give out.
The movie is so so amazing,you can never afford missing this i tell you.
This film is by far and away the best "mafia" movie in history. It makes you root for the "bad guy" and sympathize with him. The acting is superb on all accounts. After this movie, most of the actors became famous beyond belief. It is a must see, and that means more than once. Every time I watch this film, I find new things hidden that you would not see the first time around. Nothing compares to the story line of this film. The length of the film is well worth it. You are not bored for one second. Go watch the film, be awe struck, and write a review like the rest of us. It is not ranked number 1 for nothing.
The best movie ever I really i like it Evrething very beautiful
The Godfather left me completely speechless after watching it. Once you realize there's a Part II, you quickly go out and buy that as well. Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are superb in this epic!
One of the greatest films made. I can watch it over and over and not tire. Great acting, story and screenplay - directing is top-notch! One of the few movies that sequel versions were as good if not better than the original. Especially since most of the key actors continued on through all three movies. That's commitment!
I am 15 at the time of writing this review, and all the movies I have watched made before 1980 I didn't enjoy. It probably wasn't the films' fault; it's just I'm used to movies with realistic CGI effects, HD quality and current actors, but nonetheless I often found the films' quality too grainy to bear and the effects too cheap to appreciate. It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather.

First of all, for a film made in 1972 its film quality is superb! Also, though I didn't recognise the actors I knew they were talented. Even the ones not essential to the story. An example of this is the man in the first scene coming to the Godfather for help. His emotions seemed real, and he perfectly delivered his lines in a single, lengthly shot.

In conclusion, this movie still holds up to this generation, even those like me who generally dislike old movies. It's the best start to a trilogy that I've ever seen!

There simply isn't any point trying to put into words how good this film is. You just have to see it to believe it. Al pacino is majestic, a living legend and here is the proof. Watch this film if you haven't already.

There is no other crime movie that comes even close to Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather. Marlin Brando delivers a stunning performance alongside Al Pacino. This is a movie that truly anyone can enjoy and appreciate.
It really is one of the all time great films for numerous reasons. But what really stood out to me was Al Pacino's performance. He's so good and brings out so much dynamic to Michael's character.

In many ways, this is less of a Hollywood film and more a Greek tragedy. The fall of our roguish hero, Michael Corleone, from hotshot son of a crumbling mafia dynasty, wishing to break free from his roots, going to College and then joing the Army.

As he returns, and the safety of his world is broken away, it comes down a simple choice. Dishonour his family (who are massacred along the way) and surrender, or fight back and take over for good.

Coppola's films might not have the same drive of their narrative most films have, but what they make up for is some of the best and most simple cinematography, great characters and great acting, and for an all star-lineup... well.
Pure perfection, this is one of the greatest movies of all time
if you think that a dude mumbling with cotton stuffed in his cheeks is the hieght of great acting, this is the movie for you. this had got to be the most overated movie in the history of movies. i mean, its way too long and stretched out. boring! theres nothing here that hasnt been done better in a TV movie of the week which won't take three miserable hours of your life to do it, too. i know this has a real reputation as the best movie ever made or whatever, but i don't like to be able to drive a truck through the pauses and stretched out diologue. the truth? this is a movie for people who think that long long movies that are so dim you can't even hardly see anything are the hieght of art. -----
My father and i have the habit of watching some mafia movies one in a while but i've never seen this movie. Here i am, after watching this three hour mind-blowing experience. A great film, as all of them should be. Amazing characters and inner conflicts. Amazing story. Amazing movie.
Probably the greatest film of all time. This is a tremendous landmark in future film making. The acting is of the highest quality and helps you to mould into the esencse of the story. A very carefully and sensibly ploted film which is gripping, touching and frightening from start to end, especially in the penultimate scene where the baby is being cristened and the Corleone family kills off some of the main crime heads in New York. A must see.
For me the godfather is not just a movie it's a school of life you can learn how to live just after watchin it

There really isn't much you can say about The Godfather because it is simply the best movie ever made and anyone who says otherwise knows nothing about films. The storyline is superb, the actors are excellent and the music is good too. I thought Al Pacino should have gotten something for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. Funny how he never got a Golden Globe or Oscar for this part but yet it's that character that he is known for most. Francis Ford Coppola got this production perfect down to the smallest detail. This movie is truly a work of art and no other film has even come close to its stature. It is a triumph no other movie has been able to recreate! Everybody around the world must see this film at least once!
I always thought that the godfather was kind of boring until I watched it this past year. I never fully grasped the idea of the mob. Also I couldn't get past the first half hour. But once I did I went on to watch the second and then the third one too. This movie is filled with drama, action and gore. If you love gun action and movies with deception you'll love how things play out in this movie. There isn't any comedy in my opinion only great sayings that stick with you and great scenes. If you have ever seen "you've got mail" and the godfather you'll know that if your a guy it is essential to see this movie. If you don't see it, you will be missing out on the best movie of all time.
If you are one of those film-goers who do not have a long attention span, are not able to digest more comlicated dialogue and only appreciate mindless action thrillers then this film is not for you. For the rest of us it is the greatest movie ever made. 10/10


Whenever i saw a list of the top 100 movies, "The Godfather" was always on top. I had no clue why. I heard it was really good so i felt i should see it. So one evening, after all my homework was done, i sat down on the couch in front of the TV and surfed through the channels and i land upon a memo saying, "The Godfather: Next at 8 pm" So i decide to just watch maybe an hour or so of it and then go to sleep. I stayed up the whole night watching it. The acting in the movie was excellent and the cinematography was great. The characters were so believable that whenever i see a picture/movie of any character in the movie, the first thing that pops into my brain is their character name. After watching the movie, i couldn't stop talking about it to all my friends. Now i understand why its always on top of top 100 lists.
This has got to be the most overrated movie of all time. When I found out about this infamous movie with a score this high. I was 100% sure I would have a good time. But as you know from the title this wasn't the case. I can understand that some people really like this movie. But for me this movie was just an average movie way too slow paced. And that probably has alot to do with the age of the movie it is after all from 1972. I am aware that if this would be released now it would be alot worse but maybe if they had waited a few years and released it in the 80s it could have been better even though you all think it is perfect. Maybe I am delusional or just too young too experience this "masterpiece" as you all call it. After all I have only just turned 18. I would love to have someone explain to me what makes this movie so good otherwise I guess I will just rewatch this in a few years.
now i've seen stupid movies, but this one was the stupidest most pathetic movie i've ever seen. i dont understand how people can like it. too much violence. i recommend you dont waste your time watching this abomination. i give this a -9 out of 10.
undoubtebly the best movie ever and godfather part 2 is easily the second best and im sick of people saying part 3 is s*** its not that bad it easily should be in the top 50 movies ever . marlon brando by the way is easily the best actor ever without question his acting in on the waterfront ' the godfather, and apocalypse now was second to none. al pacino and robert deniro are the next best without question you only have to watch movies like dog day afternoon , scarface,taxi driver, raging bull,scent of a women ,heat, the deer hunter, not to mention their roles in the godfather
, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the "greatest film of all time" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a "historical family saga" as a crime or gangster film.

Don't understand what is so special about the movie. Certainly doesn't deserve to be the best movie ever.
this film can truely be identified as a landmark film. It has all the details that make up a true great film. Marlon Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all great especially Brando. Francis Ford Coppola directs his best movie right here. If you have never seen this classic what a shame, this is truely a classic in every case.

Rated R: Strong Violence, Language and Sexuality
This is Cinema history. The acting is beautiful. The story is excellent. The writing is great. Every man can relate to this movie because they see qualities in these men; Vito(we see the man we want to be, wise and caring to his own), Sonny(the strong man, fierce and respected for such), Fredo(the beloved son, but jealous), Tom (smart, serious, but a bit of an outsider), and of course Micheal (the sucessor to the family name). If you like this movie, read the book. Its even better.
"The Godfather" shows us all how high can the grade of a movie be. How a movie can become a standard and continue to rule over the years. Even in this edge of ultra- modern technology, "The Godfather" totally shakes the very basic of my movie knowledge. I've never imagined. Ever! It just takes control over my mind.
One of the best movies i have ever seen! 10 stars out of 10

Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.
The godfather is a special movie.The Godfather is an instant classic, a masterpiece of the American Film industry and one of the greatest films that has ever been done. Like i said in the summary, this film contains action scenes that are brutal and everybody knows despite not yet having seen the godfather, because this film is excellent, so we already seen some of its scenes. I remember that before i see this brilliant film, i had already seen one of its greatest scenes in the Simpson's's. Well, i would just like to say to the ones who haven't seen this movie yet, that this is definitely one of the movies that we must see before we die. The Godfather brutal action scenes, an awesome story and a great great great performance by Marlon Brandon as Don Corleone. Don Corleone is one of my favorites characters of all time. is quotes are legendary. You must see the godfather. It's perfect

It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, "The Godfather" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. "The Godfather" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.
The first movie of one of the best trilogies of all times. A classic. With outstanding performances from Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and an incipient, but extremely talented Al Pacino. The GodFather transports you to the dark world of the Italian Mafia, how they managed their business, their families. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), head of one of the five Italian mafia families, manages to control his business (Alcohol, Game, Women) with his son Sonny (James Caan), his stepson Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and his loyal friend Clemenza. He develops good social relations with the Government, and important business men. When other families want to take advantage of Don Corleone's relations, in order to introduce drugs and deal with them, Don Corleone refuses to share his contacts. A war between families starts with an apparent truce. A must-watch trilogy.
Each decade of my own life brings out more nuances of understanding the life of this fictionalized mobster classic. Love the depths of characters and the skilled role play.
The Godfather in my mind is also one of the greatest movies of any genre, Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece.worthy of preservation by the National Film Registry, and won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay. This film has a large, brilliant cast of actors, most notably Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan, who arguably gave the most memorable performances of their careers. The Godfater stands alone, and is a classic in the true sense of the word.


Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.

It's the one of the greatest movies ever , it deserves a 11 not 10 for there is no movie can compete with it

Godfather such a beautiful movies. My favourite Sir Marlon Brando at his best. The scene where Don's adopted son sings a song at his sisters wedding is so natural that you feel its not an acting its reality. A must must watch...
Extremely boring & slow movie I've just wasted my time

OSM movie all time biggest movie of mine. I think no movie can be compared to this one.I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
Start to finish, you're into it! Best film I have ever watched!
Godfather Trilogy, is a masterpiece of international cinematography!
The Godfather Trilogy, is a masterpiece of international cinematography!
I think the godfather is one of the greatest movie of all time and that's a #fact
I Think The People Know The Godfather and don Vito Corleone and His Family are more than people Go cinemas godfather trilogy is complex of excellent directing acting writing charactering costume design somebody likes Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption or any Movie But I am Sure All of Them agree with me godfather is Greatest Picture of Cinema for Example Don Vito Corleone is symbol of gangsters no Al Capone or Acting of Al Pacino the Great he change the acting for all of history but a great question is why ford Coppola never back to golden age after apocalypse now. if he repeat masterpieces I am sure he became great director of all time. see the godfather and enjoy it because it is not for 1970s it's a movie for all time
For me i can't think of anything negative about this movie, it is simply a masterpiece, and i firmly believe that if anyone hates on this movie he just does not understand cinema, the plot,cinematography,characters,sound,writing,pacing everything is perfect, It is hard nowdays to find a movie as good as the old ones especially this one and it could easily be top 1 movie.
I'm Italian myself just learning to speak English. I know what real mafia is and this movie brought tears to my eye's. My name is the big "T" because of my size. I Think... No I Know that Italians are the best actors. Just look at the movie. Robert Deniro, Al Pacino, Marlin Brando, and Robert Duval. Even though he is Irish Italians made him the actor he is today. To end this on a happy note. Anybody who disliked this movie should be sleeping with the fishes. Gratzi.
Every character seems to be perfectly embedded, everyone has a specified reason to be in the plot and each one brings something substantial that makes us remember them. It is magnificent how the main characters show an ironic mix between honesty, respect, etc. and anger, betrayal and many other facets that makes us ask if they're good or bad people. Beyond a classification for the characters, you gonna love them as they are, and we can understand that there's more than just black and white. Definitely, a movie to watch, no matter how many years from his release, and no, I can't say that is a gangster movie, neither that is a Pacino's Movie, no no, It's more than that, The Godfather could be called for to many people like "The Movie".
This movies keeps surprising me. I have never seen Al Pacino in a better part. Marlon Brando was a legend then already, but only became one for me after this movie. The mix of family-honour, realistic action/ murders and the incredible cast makes this film one of my all-time favorites!
best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...best movie i ever seen, i watch like four times in the year...
Someone please explain why a movie about a gang who use physical nastiness to get a point across has become so beloved? Because they get away with it? Okay, so it was filmed in the dark...what a breakthrough for the industry. Of course, I do tend to go against the majority somewhat.

It's good enough, but I save higher praises for at least eighty other movies.
It's true! A visually beautiful film with a powerful story and amazing

performances. How could it possibly be improved upon?
This movie gives the audience a look at what family really means. "The Godfather" has the cast, writing, score, directing, and cinematography that makes great movies. The story of the Corleone family is one that endures. It is less about crime and more about the trials of any normal family. It casts light on the hypocrisy of the establishment through showing society its own dark underbelly. The thought that a mafia don is no different than a Senator or President (Kay and Michael's discussion after Michael returns from Sicily and tells Kay he is running the family business), shows how naive society can be and how quick it is to offer blame on people who believe in something as opposed to nothing. All in all one of the Ten Best movies of all time.
The Golden Era of Hollywood in the late sixties and early seventies produced unbelievable work, but there are a handful of films here that set a different standard for masterpiece. Why The Godfather is at the top of them I do not know, but it definitely reaches out and pulls you in that direction. In its company are perhaps only four pictures: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 2001, Midnight Cowboy, and Chinatown. The only actor left out of this realm is De Niro, and if you include Taxi Driver, you have to mention Dog Day Afternoon, A Clockwork Orange, Don't Look Now and Apocalypse Now- all bonafide masterpieces, but missing something in the breath of the first five. (Let's not forget where film here created myths on a par with all the greats of cultures old: Star Wars (and bringing to life the definitive one, Excalibar). Shall we not forget The Graduate? Two words: The Godfather!
I personally believe that this movie is overrated. I don't really even believe it is the best work from a Coppola (I personally believe "Apocalypse Now" and "Lost in Translation" are much better movies), but it still is entertaining to watch. It has notable performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino (perhaps the only Pacino performance other than "Glengarry Glen Ross" where he doesn't scream his eyes out), and the film also has a very nice screenplay, but the movie isn't as entertaining or extraordinary as other frontrunners like "Casablanca" or "Lawrence of Arabia". Maybe because this movie has been marred by so many rip-offs or clones, that the magic of the film has disappeared. The film just no longer feels ageless, and that's too bad.
Top notch performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and the rest of the cast and crew. Truly, the best picture of all time. 10 out of 10.
This is simply one of the greatest movies of all time. With amazing performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan, and Marlon Brando. I know it is one of my favorites and I would recommend this film to anyone who really likes and a appreciates movies.
Along with it's sequel, Godfather II, this movie is what American movies should aspire to. Great acting, great story line. The power of the family, the immigrants' rise to glory, the failures of society, the paradox of religion and violence woven together to form the perfect movie. The characters are composites of real men and women in history. The scenes fictionalize real historical events. The Don's granting wishes to his neighbors remind you of Marranzano's despotic rule in the early 30's. The shooting in the restaurant mirrors Luciano's assassination of Masseria. Moe Green's execution is really Bugsy Segal's. The climax is the night of the Sicilian Vespers. This film is a classic. Puzo's work is wonderful and Coppola's vision is perfect.
Good script, Great casting,excellent acting,is very strong

The best movie i ever seen !! I see it again and again !!! The Godfather is my favorite movie !!!
"Never hate your enemies,It affect your judgement" The most greatest gangster movie which a man can't miss!
It's not just the gangsters or the atmosphere...It's the recreation of the time. It's the music. It's the tension.

Sometimes, a film just gets everything right. This is one of those times.
I have watched hundred of movies in the last 10 years and my all time favourite is/was "The shawshank redemption" i have always seen it as the best movie ever made but after watching "godfather" i just don't know anymore which one should be in top for me, one thing i'm sure of right now is that i have 2 favourite best movies instead of one.
I watched it 2 times and still dont see why people are so obsessed with this movie. There's nothing extraordinary about this film.
The top ranked movie on Critically Tripled's Top 200 Movies of all time! If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must be living in a box. The DVD set is truly amazing a must own! If you want to see more of Critically Tripled and who else is on the Top 200 Movies and many other options please respond to this review to me via e-mail or via post! And if you don't, it's ok, because if I wanted you dead, I would have killed you already.
Grown up watching this, and its a classic that everybody should watch at least once.
I have been looking for a better film than this one for a long time, i have been looking for better acting, directing or writing but i haven't find it yet, not even the great geniuses of Bergman or Fellini have deliver us with such a masterpiece. Brando at his best, and the big appearances of such actors as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire and many others. The writing is superb, i've read the book, and together with the film they are both my favorites, and the directing is Coppola getting the whole essence of the honor, respect, devotion, love, desire and revenge. is totally illogical that two films like the dark knight or the The Shawshank Redemption (great films by the way) are better voted that this, the greatest masterpiece on cinematic history
I watched this movie for the first time in 2018 and i enjoyed watching it a lot, which made me repeat it five times the godfather icon can not watch like it after 1 000,000 years
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
Brilliant work must see for see for this film will never and shall never get old
When you ask people who know about film what they like the most about The Godfather you'll get a fast response: EVERYTHING! It's not the story or the actors or the director or whatever, it's everything together. Everything works out so good, even under the heavy stress Francis Ford Coppola worked with throughout the movie. Maybe that's what makes this movie so great...
A must watch for every movie buff and specially for Fans of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The story shows how a man balances his work and family so well keeping in mind that his business is full of threat. Character of Vito Corleone defines what a real man is like and on the other hand Character of Michael Corleone shows how to contain anger and utilize it in most lethal way possible. This Story also shows how the mafia families have ruled the cities with both good and bad to their characters.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen.
One of the best movie ever i watched.dont miss it, if anyone missed this watch it on amazon prime.
He was helpless, but used his life to make people understand how to learn to face difficulties.
Eight years later, it is necessary to revise my own views. The shabby ness is still, but there are also countless great plots and performances by the screenwriter and actors. You can also find that "The Godfather" brings audience a "big screen" experience which is enough to refute the opposition.

I'm gonna make you an offer you cant refuse......... watch Fanboy & Chum Chum, it's so good
My brother is a big fan of this movie, he suggested me to watch this and I must say I loved it. This is a fabulous movie of all time.
Such a boring movie. I'm a very well established psychiatrist and I was disgusted and bewildered by the lack of care the characters had for themselves in this film. What on earth was Michael Corleone doing not taking antidepressants?! Michael was a very depressed character and the fact he didn't seem to take any antidepressants in this film baffles me as I thought that would've been obvious for him to do.

Antidepressants may be undertested a lot and may frequently make people infertile but it's totally worth it if it means stopping a potential suicide of someone like Michael. I'm disgusted with this movie and my heart ached for the Autistic man known as Michael Corleone to get help and good drugs from a pharmacy in this movie.
Probably the best Mafia ever! So many scenes that depict the life of living with the gangsters. A great cast of family in crime, and the trials of families involved.
How this movie has to be #1 is a mystery, then I see that Lord of Rings is #5 and I understand. Just think people rated this movie #1 cause other did it. A kind of conformism. The story is completely non-sense. What's the deal in a mafia family's revenge? Good actors don't mean good movie, good director doesn't mean good movie. If the story lacks then direction and acting are worthless. This movie is BORING! There's no emotional scene in all movie, oh well if you except the horse in the bed. There's anyway some funny moments, as the way are pictured the mafia guys in Sicily, really outdated. Lol Make a favour to yourself, this movie is almost 3 hours long, add another hour and watch to "Once upon a time in America", a real epic tale on gangster. This Godfather was a big disappointment :(
I mean - Is there even a competition? Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption, Citizen Kane - as great as these Films are, none of them even comes close to this Masterpiece. Truly cinema-changing gem wich does everything right.


The Godfather is an absolute "Classic". Both Al Pacino and Robert DeNero killed their roles. It's not often we get a movie with such in-depth detail as to why things happened the way they did. Politically correct in every "bad" way. I was very young when i first seen this movie and really didn't grasp the exact concept. Now, as an adult, it all makes sense. If anyone reading this has never seen this movie, I recommend you watch it and the others as well. It might even touch home with most that grew up in these neighborhoods and countries during the date allocated within the film. Film makers and anyone acting should make it an occupation to watch this film. Exciting, passionate, dramatic. These are the words I use to best describe my experience with watching this movie. It has also sparked my interest in making my own films. The action and originality of the film makes me want to create a movie just like this one in modern day times. Thank you Godfather, for you have given me much needed inspiration.

This is the best move of all time.I have watched it several times and all the graphics ,acting,story is just outstanding
Even if you aren't a fan of "gangster" (I ashamedly use this overworked and extremely juvenile description for the sake of clarification- this movie deserves much better!) movies, or aren't fond of movies in general, this is a must-see!

The sheer power and volatility which emanates from every scene and every dialogue will mesmerize and captivate you! At times the graphic violence makes you want to look away, but you find yourself held fast to the film's hypnotic lure. The masterful story-telling, superb casting, and richly authentic ambience combine to create a once-in-a-lifetime work of art- a bold and breathtaking saga of not only the Corleone Family, but of a culture and world heretofore unknown to the vast majority of mainstream Americana. It is an incredible tale both heart-stopping and gut-wrenching, at once amazingly complex and beautifully simple. Salud!
I'll start off by saying, as the title says that this is most certainly one of the best movies I ever watched. The movie is fun to watch, what's most important and it's not just for certain parts of the movie, but the whole movie all the way through from the beginning to the end is interesting and unpredictable. This is something that today's movies lack, and what the movies from the past always had which made them great. Story of the movie if fascinating allowing us to see what the real "mobster world", underground world to be precise looked in the 1960's, 1970's as many scenes in the movie show us. All in all this is one hell of a movie and I'd suggested to everyone to watch.
A masterpiece is just about all there is to say about this film. A cinematic jewel who's only competition is its own sequel. The Godfather is probably the most quoted (and spoofed) movie in history. Every single thing about this film is perfect. The home-movie feel, the cast, the crew- everything. What more is there to say? 10/10


I went into this movie with the mindset of this will be overrated. After watching, Goodfellas, The Departed, and The Irishman, I expected The Godfather would be the same. All I expected from it was to be the first best mob movie, which set the trend of all other mob movies. As I started watching it, I quickly realized it isn't like the other mob movies. It is better. It has more of a story and character development. The Godfather is one of the best mob movies ever, with an actual story and character development. The acting is impressive, and the story is even better. This is 100% a must-watch if you are into mob movies or classic movies.
From Freddo, to Vito and Michael, the acting in this movie is too good, you forget you're watching one. Every single character in this movie is an icon. The score is also great and sets a very chilling atmosphere. The experience from watching this movie is like none other. It is very engaging and I can easily say it is one of the best films I've ever seen. Yes. I say film now because it sounds more passionate than movie. If you haven't seen this film don't wait. This and Part 2 will be one of your all time favorites. Part 2 is boring if you haven't seen Part 1 (I made that mistake because of my college film professor). But once you watch part 1, Part 2 is equally good and both are top 5 films of all time.
The Godfather is an excellent movie for: 1.- The Actors 2.- The Director 3.- The Music (in my opinion a magic soundtrack) In conclusion the best film about gangsters in the history (although the Second part don't is least)
Brando, Paccino, James Caan, Robert Duvall. What an ensemble of talent. And of course Francis Ford Coppola.

Behind the it's sequel, this film in my opinion is the second best film ever to be made.
I did not have high expectations before watching the movie cause I thought it may be overrated. I could not be more wrong about this initial thought. Probably the best most incredibly done mafia movie I have ever watched. After watching some of Scorsese's best mafia movies I thought I had already met cinematic excellence, but "The Godfather" overcomes that. Al pacino and Brando's acting is good enough to make any cinema lover whip a tear. Definitely a must see film.
A perfect movie with its acting, script, image and the way the story works.

You are taking a great step into the mafia world with the realism of the created world inside.

The fact that each actor plays their role at the highest level adds a different atmosphere to the film.

I don't want to extend it too long, it's simply a perfect movie.
The determination of Vito that Michael inherits is brutal, it is not a determination that grates with recklessness (as is the case of Santino), it is a determination that waits patiently, as in that dialogue from Cómodo in Gladiator, about the waiting viper. This aspect of the film may come from the same book, but the distant glances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino before the problems seem incredible to me, of how they plan and ruminate thoughts and plans simply sitting in a chair. I love this movie.
The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover.
Next to Vertigo, The Godfather is my favorite movie. The feeling of family is well expressed in the film and although Coppola was criticized for "glorifying the mafia family", the film does not show that but shows a devotee to his father, and his undieing love for his family. The music is great, the atmospheres are great, and the acting is superb. Marlon Brando is at his best in his Oscar winning role, and Al Pacino delivers a superb performance as one of the most well known characters in movie history. No other person would be able to deliver the character of Michael Corleone better then Al Pacino. This is truly a magnificent picture and not much else can be said about it. See for yourself the splendor of Coppola's Oscar winning family.
I agree, it's not a movie that everyone will like. But it is a movie that fans will really like.
Can not say anything this film was just marvelous. Despite that the actors were incredible amazingly perfect!
Possibly the best mob movie, and possibly the best movie you will ever see. This movie has plenty of mob violence and extreme thinking to find out the enemy that hides in the shadows. Marlon Brando is possibly the best actor you can find for a godfather. The unexpected son Michael becomes the Godfather and is violent and will destroy whatever enemy opposes the Corleones. It also had a great ending, where the two people kiss Michael on the hand, where he is officially the Godfather. Great movie.
In my opinion a good movie is one that makes you feel diffrent when you leave the theater, or puts a feeling on you that you haven't experienced. You have a true feeling that you got just by watching somthing.

I also ask what makes and entertaining movie. To me its one that you just cant get enough of. You can watch over and over again and it never gets old.
Phenomenal acting by all cast members. It really illustrates some part of the world we live especially when it comes the Italian Mafia. Nothing more to say about it other than The God Father was the pinaccle of flawless films.
This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever. The acting is 10/10 the story is 10/10 and the whole movie is just amazing its an absolute classic.


it is not good as pulp fiction, because this film just shows that an older mafia dies and his son takes control, this type of films are more common,but pulp fiction which is a master piece and narrates an hit mans story with good type of narrating. this film does not deserve to be in 1st place, because they didn't made any effort on acting. it also has many errors on film making.this film was a good movie for those who saw the movie in the olden days, but now the this film has no effect on the viewer, but movies like pulp fiction, the shaw shank redemption are really extraordinary creations of directors. i don't know why it is still stuck in the 1st place.
Very powerful acting, story, directing, and everything else. I really can't compliment this in ways that everybody else hasn't already, so that's it.

Deserves to be number one. 9/10.
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
I believe that "The Godfather" is a masterpiece, an excellent movie which I have seen about 6 times. I have not gotten bored by watching it, thus I wait for a next opportunity to watch it again. The problem is that now I feels like a 90 minutes movie instead of a 171 minute film. But it's still great. I saw the three movies in one day, and let me tell you that the movie changed my life. My mind thought differently and I began to feel stronger, better self confidence. I'm not saying that I started to kill, but I can relate to this film. Probably I'm not the only Godfather fan with this feeling. I can confess that I've not read the book, but before I die I will read it. I recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it. It's worth it. I wish I were born before the movie came out so I could see it at a movie theater. I am waiting for the DVD version, and I hope it comes out soon. So I guess I will have to buy a DVD player!!! But for now I enjoy it in VHS digitally remastered. The acting is incredible, like if the actors were real, like if the Corleone Family really existed or does exist.
The film is almost three hours, but you can't call it long, making it two hours long would have turned out to be a stump that would have lost its value. In three hours, a whole life unfolded on the screen with all its charms and blows. We can see how people change over time. And what previously seemed alien, wrong in an instant becomes everything in a person's life. As I said, a film of incredible depth, to conquer which you need to see the story to the end.

10 of 10.
The body language as well as the character of the godfather of the film are included and we see his beautiful acting. This film shows the prestige of a powerful person and at the same time Badright.
There's nothing bad you can say about this movie, it's just that good. From the screenplay to the performances it is just perfect. There will never be another movie like this.
Brando and Pacino were amazing the story was amazing, so iconic, nostalgic and inspiring. Best Along with part 2 the most beautiful and entertaining movies ever.
This movie is like football, people only watch it because the think its 'cool' or 'popular', but really it is the most dreary repetitive and slow film i have had the displeasure in viewing.

How this film grew to be such a ''great'' i do not know, bu ti know that it shouldn't be, Shawshank Redemption may not deserve to be second best film ever, but at least it is worthy of being where it is and is certainly a better film than any of the Godfathers.

So please consider this when voting, the Godfather is poorly directed, badly scripted, crudely acted and most importantly is, quite frankly boring and wearisome.
The Godfather is a masterpiece in terms of cinematic achievements which boasts near flawless acting most notably from Brando at his scene stealing best. The film is brought to life with a strong script and a haunting score from Nino Rota. If you care for films, make sure you get out and see this. It is brutal without being unnecessarily graphic and moving without being unnecessarily sentimental. We build up a fantastic relationship with the characters and we care an awful lot when something important happens to them. It has been said that this film "gets better as time goes on" but I am not so sure of this as the general taste of the audience is not for this kind of film. It is a refreshing break from the mind-numbing trauma that is Transformers and other heartless Hollywood Blockbusters. One of the greatest films of the 70s? No. One of greatest films of all time!
The Godfather is the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando played his part so well. Al Pacino also played is part well as well. The setting was fantastic and the plot was engaging. The use of camera work was just outstanding. I don't know why anyone would hate this film. It is the best gangster/mobster ever produced. This movie is way better than 'Goodfellas' or 'Scarface'. This movie had so many Oscar winning actors which boosted the rating of this movie right up. There are some action scenes in this movie and they are fantastic to watch. But the best part of the movie has to be the acting and how engaging the characters are. For everyone who was reluctant to get this movie, I suggest you buy this film or hire it out because it is a blast.


The movie is too long and almost put me asleep. Even though,great acting by Al. The story is not unique and not interesting. I know it's popular to love the movie as a classic piece, but i didn't like it so much.
As an Qatari man watching this film for the first time in 2009, it struck me how much I got attached. More than four decades later, and a generation apart, and to a culture so distant from mine, and still this film strikes as one of the most memorable. What makes it that was the question that not only haunted me for years, but also pushed me to study filmmaking and dive intro the subject. This film has not only influenced my awareness and thinking, but ultimately my career and life.
I am not a big fan of the sequels even the second is a big step down from this one. What a cast? Like an earlier reviewer said; REWATCHABLE!! Yes, I am Italian, not a Sicilian, and I have seen it hundreds of times. What a cast: Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall. Even the supporting cast is excellent with the film noir legend Richard Conte as Barzini. Puzo wrote such a rich, deep script. The characters suck you in and are so lifelike. Each brother is radically different from the other. Fredo, the mama's boy, the useless one who Michael kills off in the second one. Sonny, the human volcano, with a temper that has to be seen to be believed. Michael, the quiet and deadly one most like Vito but colder more ruthless. Michael was always outside the family looking in; he was held in contempt by the rest as the soft college boy who didn't want to get his hands dirty. This is the answer to the riddle of how he could kill Fredo, his own brother, later in the second one. Notice where he sits at the wedding, as far away from the family as he can get.
This movie has it all, great acting by Marlon Brando and James Caan, great characters, the same two, and great action and story. The aspect that carries this movie is the great acting by Marlon Brando that totally gets you into the Don Corleone character and introduces you to the world of the mafia and all of their families.
The Godfather is one of the best movies ever, the movie is made for 30 years ago and it´s the best movie i ever seen and will see. If you think " Casino", or " Goodfellas", is a great gangster movie than you should see The Godfather all parts. I recommend this movie to all over 18 so they can see the beauty on this, i dont really belive the teenager will see that.


This must be the best movie I've seen. I watched this movie for over 5 times. Every scene and clue are useful. Those complicated relationship built a web for the fate of the chosen boy, which finally taught him to grow up as a grown man. I love this movie
everyone knows its one of the best movie. but you don't know is this is the movie that comes once in the history... its made me think like i am the godfather. i am the MOB !! you can not say if the actors are acting... its real..

missing this art, should be considered as a self-disgrace. i don't know what the associates got into them, and if that is normal or spiritual (if there is) but surely it is something that can not me done again.. thanks to everyone to giving one audience this much of peace and something beyond words ..

THANK YOU !!
I loved the movie script and casting. It's hard to fine a movie done this well.
Everybody know the fate of the Carleone Family. Everybody knows the voice of Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. The Story is exciting, sad and lucky. Francis Ford Copolla's Masterwork is fascinating and the highest art of making films. This artwork has to be called biggest and highest literature of movie arts!!
This is absolutely the best movie I've ever seen. Such drama, best actors ever and a story which make hamlet look like a school theater play! Godlike Marlon Brando as a Godfather in a mafia family, Perfect! And Al Pacino as his son! It can't be any better. you who haven't seen it, SEE IT!
This is a strong film with great acting. Marlon is at this BEST in this film. The story line is strong and well written. Audiences are holding on to every moment to see what is going to happen next. #FABULOUS
There is no such thing as a perfect movie. But god damn it, the Godfather comes close. The storyline, the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the cinematografie. It's all really good. It is a classic movie I believe everyone should see at least one time in their life. Yes the sit is kinda long, but the time flies by so fast you won't even notice it. And after 3 hours, you still want more.
The best screen play of all time. The cast, the setting, the storyline, make this movie an all time great. With names like Pacino, Brando and De Niro associated with the Godfather, was it ever going to fail? I don't think so. A true classic, depicting family values in its truest form, a must see for the generations of both today and tomorrow.
Movie maybe old and Black'n White but it's a Real gem. Strongly recommend everyone to watch.
Very overrated and i waste 3h of my life watching this old movie.. I hate when somebody talk about the godfather's acting
There are those rare kind of movies that you can watch over and over again. The Godfather is definitely one of those. It's a timeless work of art. Never have I watched a 3 hour movie that had me gripped from start to finish. It's a movie about family, greed, religion, honor where you really feel for the characters. The story is fantastic, the acting superb(especially Marlon Brando), the music, the set pieces... everything comes together in this masterpiece. It's also on of those few old movies that I can watch again and again.

I can't praise this movie high enough. In my opinion the greatest movie of all time!!!



Title says it all.... This movie was long, and cut out the best parts of the book. It had a good cast, but that can't make up for poor transition from the novel. Bottom line: read the book, it's better.
The 1st instalment of Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather is considered by many to be in the top 50 films of all time. It has everything you want in an all time classic, with exceptional acting from the likes of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall. Mario Puzo's classic novel adaption delivers one of the few adaptations of a book that's better than the book itself. With perfect soundtrack, perfect dialogue and perfect acting, Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the best films you will ever see in cinema history.
My husband loves this movie so I tried watching it. Really don't know why it is so highly rated. Hard to get into it. Very slow start.
Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour.

okay i saw this movie and it isn't really worthy of being in list of top 5 movies. i mean i have seen many movies that are 'much better' than this movie.personally i found this movie to be just about the people who say 'family first' and believe too much in morals and honor. the movie is good but its not really that good to be rated in the top 5 movies.

the movie is slow and very slow and at moments i felt sleepy with those dialogs regarding how one should treat another or how if you do this you wont get porked or whatever. i am rating this 6 for okay-ish plot and good acting.
One of the best films! Probably the best gangster - mafia drama of all time!


Francis Coppola's The Godfather, and Godfather pt. II have made their names known rightfully as masterpieces of cinema. They are both executed with razor-like care and crafted atop a foundation of brilliant actors, a brilliant director, a brilliant script by a brilliant writer, brilliant photography, brilliant production design, and a brilliant score. And it was the first film to give mainstream insight to the world of Ogranised Crime - an insight so true that Mario Puzo was questioned by the Mafia about his sources.

But The Godfather is not just a vehicle of power for its wonderful foundations and brilliant everything, it is a drama about war between families - about destruction within families. From the film's buoyant wedding opening scene, we are instantly emerged in Coppola and Puzo's world of rich characters and gripping stories. This film could have been about a mining family in the nineteenth century - though things would have to change - and it would still be as entertaining, as tragic, as exciting, and as masterful as it is just now.
I Think The People Know The Godfather and don Vito Corleone and His Family are more than people Go cinemas godfather trilogy is complex of excellent directing acting writing charactering costume design somebody likes Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption or any Movie But I am Sure All of Them agree with me godfather is Greatest Picture of Cinema for Example Don Vito Corleone is symbol of gangsters no Al Capone or Acting of Al Pacino the Great he change the acting for all of history but a great question is why ford Coppola never back to golden age after apocalypse now. if he repeat masterpieces I am sure he became great director of all time. see the godfather and enjoy it because it is not for 1970s it's a movie for all time
Yeah its a good movie I guess, not the greatest of all time in my book but still vastly enjoyable by movie fans of all sorts, even fans of other types of movies



I thought that The Godfather Part I was the best movie I have ever seen in my life. The amazing acting by Marlon Brando just blew me away. The story was so rich and probable. There was quite a bit of violence and adult themes, but these were essential to the realism and texture of the film. The thing that gave it it's brilliance was the acting, and the story. I most definitely agree with the place it is in on the IMDb top 250. Overall, i think this movie deserved a standing ovation. Marvelous. Outstanding. 10 out of 10. It was a superb film and I think that if you have not watched it, you must do so. This is a must see movie.
If anything is close to being perfect, this is it...
The Godfather Trilogy is a classic combination which connects and represents the living Visible lovely Golden Era of Fame and Glory of 1972.

The Godfather of the Corleone Mafia Family showing the complexities of that time of the MAFIA .

The mafia is represented to be an Organized Crime Family which is Represented in the AfterWar of WWII .

Showing what Mafia Figment of things happened in Families of New York.

**************THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST CLASSICS EVER************
Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film.The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry.The Writing was awesome.I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.
This is the best movie of all the time. My favourite movie ever!
The story....the cinematography...and the actors! And ol the actors are at there best. Line after line and the inesity that makes part of the family through out this film. You relate to them in a way that you root for the gangster
Of you didn't like this movie, just go and play hockey because you don't know anything about the cinema

When I was in high school I took a cinema class and the teacher showed the Godfather I & II. I personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring. There was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way. If you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you.

I don't mind seeing a movie about the mafia and gangs if it is entertaining. When I was forced to watch the Godfather I & II in my cinema class I wish I had a pillow to put on my desk so that I could sleep.

If you every have trouble getting to sleep at night just put the Godfather on and you will be asleep in no time.
This movie is awesome. I've been in love with this movie (and the other two) since I was a young girl. And I think partly due to this movie, I love movies with violence. Not that this movie has tons of violence in it, but it has enough to leave a lasting impression on a young person. It has been said many, many times before that "all I need to know, I learned from the Godfather" and truer words have never been spoken. At it's core, The Godfather is about family values. This movie isn't only about the mob or drugs or any of those things that's just one part of it, but ultimately, it's about family. Despite not exactly having anything in common with the characters, this movie has left a mark on my life that could not have been placed there by another movie. This is THE best movie. Great job Puzo & Coppola. RIP Mr. Puzo.
Nice Movie! I love this film so much. The Godfather is the best series i have ever seen.

I think the Godfather is the greatest movie which is ever made. I was a little boy when i saw the film and since then I have think that it is the greatest movie and it´s still the greatest. I love the Godfather! And that is the reason why I want to be a director in the future.
I hate mob movies and even though this is a classic, the genre means it is less than desirable. Mob movies have one thing in common: they are SLOW! Their main theme is character development and the characters they develop are not worth knowing.
When I first saw this movie, I was amazed. It became one of my favorite movies of all time. The Godfather is a mix of perfect Directing, Story Telling, and Acting. Marlon Brando of course was great as Don Vito, Al Pacino was awesome as Michael, Robert DuVall, James Caan, James Cazale, and Diane Keaton were all great in this movie. The thing I like most about the movie is that, although it is fictional, it is very accurate on how the Italian Mafia was. I mean the realism of the Crime Family and all the conflicts that they had with other rival Families. Francis Ford Coppolla and Mario Puzo did a awesome job on adapting the original novel to the screenplay. It is just simply magnificent. 10/10.
My father tried to sit me down and watch this when I was younger. He had always said it was required viewing. I never understood it and subsequently forgot most of it until I just recently watched it again. Wow, just wow. I felt all of the emotions every character portrays in this masterpiece of american drama
And somebody has to do something about this hype Honestly bad acting, boring and shallow plot the movie is beeing watched only due to its hype
I honestly can't understand those who voted one star for this movie: probably they're trying to counter-balance the great number of 9 and 10 given by many viewers. This movie is complete, with very good actors, enchanting music and a nice plot. The behavior of the characters and their way of speaking is accurate, the atmosphere of the scenes set in Sicily is real and so is the portrait of a "famiglia" with that kind of activities. This movie is the "standard" for all the following movies about mafia and it created a collective imaginary about this subject like no other movie. Some parts may be a bit long, but if you start enjoying the moves, the glares and the dialogues of the characters you will like them just like the action parts. I don't know if this movie deserves to be #1 of all times but surely it's the best movie of the genre I've ever seen.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.
The book was an excellently written piece, and the film most definitely does it justice. With a star studded cast, a strong plot behind it, and great videography this film has secured its place in Americas film hall of fame.

The performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando Robert Duvall, James Caan, et. al. are amazing. The most amazing thing to be a part of, as an audience member, is to be fully invested in the characters (in terms of commitment to their character).

I would highly recommend this movie for any old film buffs, or anyone looking for an old school mobster film, and finally anyone looking for a truly excellent film.

It feels that the movie skipped and adapted so much stuff, which makes it even harder to understand. Might want to read the book.

Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,Francis Ford Coppola,Mario Puzo,and the filmhistory.One of the best movies ever.The Godfather always give me power.
I have been watching movies since last 35 years but have never been drawn more to a movie that can influece you to make your own film. Thats what made me a film maker to be honest. Reading Mario Puzos Godfather and seeing how it translated onto the silver screen told me how the writer in me could become the person who can visualize.

Cinematography, Editing, Direction, Acting and all the other Crafts that make it a 24 craft game are explained in this movie as to why you need all 24 crafts to be perfect. To make a masterpiece.

Godfather has been adapted by thousands or filmmakers which made a few great and a few legends, but there is no movie like the GodFather. Storaro at his very best, Brando at his prime, Al pacino in his element brought it all for the Director and the studio make their dream come true. One of those very rare must watch classics.
You can not have seen this movie its such a classic.
I Like the story of movie. fantastic naturalization of movie including sound in movie theater is very good.
Few people are not aware of the existence of this film. At least because of private mentions, references and parodies, almost everyone knows that there is such a movie and approximately what it is about. However, if you read the short description of the picture or don't watch the movie very carefully, you might get the impression that this is just an ordinary movie about gangsters. I'll be brief. Although the film is a classic, it is NOT worthy of the title of a masterpiece. What masterpiece is it when the film is just stupidly stretched for more than 2 hours thanks to the dialogues, the plot is about nothing at all. I watched it only because of the young Pacino, and then on rewind.
One of the most amazing Movies in the history. Very close to the original source and masterfully done. I believe everyone should check out this masterpiece.
Absolute masterpiece, an unforgettable mafia family saga.

To this day, I have never seen a work as well done, very well written, directed and acted as this one. Everything about this movie is perfect, both the atmosphere and the music. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie but I would watch it again if I had to.

The part where Michael knows Apollonia even though it is short is very well told. The film grips us from beginning to end. I love this movie as well as everyone's acting and I also love the second movie, I encourage all my friends to watch this masterpiece.

No other work will surpass this one, not even with the passage of time, I'm sure years and years will pass and everyone will remember this movie.
Godfather sets a new golden standard in American cinema thanks to superb storytelling and bigger-than-life characters, creating a near mythological tale about family, power and corruption.
"The Godfather" is a classic. The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history.

"The Godfather" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. Must Watch 9/10

You simply can't go wrong when you put together great actor such as Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and combine them with a great director like F.F.C. Outstanding performances, correct directing and very good story. Not the greatest of all time but sure it is in my top 10.
The Godfather is really one of the epitomes of what movies should be like. Although it is slow initially but once it gets its pace, its on a whole new level. With some of the best actors and magnificent direction, I guess it is one of the best movies ever made.
Of all the movies I have ever seen, nothing draws me in like The Godfather. Is spite of the fact that I rarely like to watch a movie more than once every five years, whenever I am flipping through the channels on cable, and I come across this movie I am always compelled to stop and watch. Regardless of what I had planned to do seldom do I get up before the movie is over.

There are so many layers to this movie. There are many different levels on which it can be appreciated. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD.
This movie is excellent. Anyone wanting proof of its greatness, just watch the baptism sequence, filmmaking at its best..... I really liked Coppala's style of having narrative scenes for a while, then punctuating it with sudden and brief scenes of violence. Everything about this movie is great. If you have not seen go to your locall video shop and watch it!
The Godfather Trilogy spreads motivation, like no one movie until today. I don't want to say that it is the best movie ever (because you shouldn't compare movies just like that), but I haven't seen anything like this. It is more than a movie, it is a lifestyle.
This is the movie that restored the motion picture business, and it's been an upward move since then. An epic by all definitions of the word, it displays a wonderful story with wonderful acting, directing, editing art direction and music. I've seen this movie three times and it holds up.
Snoozefest deluxe. Would not recommend watching this movie.
I am not really a fan of old movies even if they are high rated because they might get boring and many times the film making methods would be very outdated and would be difficult watch.

But this movie is totally an exception. We need to truly appreciate Marlon Brando's Method acting skills and it is mind blowing.

Al Pacino's expressions are fantastic.
Perfect so perfectttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
Full On entertainment. You may have seen better mafia movies but this is the all time best ones. Sit back and watch it in a good quality
When I listened from my friends that this movie is a master piece and I saw that Metacritic has given it a100% than I thought that this is a true master piece. But when I saw the movie,I felt that it's a great movie but not the greatest, as we should have some idea of the novel before watching it,so as to know what is happening in the movie ,also we don't know when the time is passing in the movie because they don't show after how many years is a event occuring in the movie (If you are confused of what I am talking about then you should see the movie). However the performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is out standing and the direction of the movie is fabulous. And when you see this crime drama you never feel that the movie is stretched upto 3hrs. However, it's my opinion about this movie ,according to me ,go for it and I promise you that that you will watch a great holly wood classic that will not disappoint you.


(100/100) The Godfather is a masterpiece and there will likely never be a movie as good or better than The Godfather


If you ever imagined a real life portrayal in the life of the godfather and families look no further. I'm writing what we all have said and all already know and that's that this movie has an amazing plot, script, music, and actors. Again no further if you really want to watch amazing classic that will never again in history be remade.
If there is a movie better than this then I have yet to see it.There isn't really a word to describe how good this movie actually is!! from start to finish this movie has you staring at the screen in amazement.No actor in this film lets it down and was shown by the academy awards when the best actor category was filled with actors from the godfather,never in history has that happened.
I dont see the big deal about this movie. I think it sucks. Everyone always talks about how good it is and that it's a classic

and it makes me just want to tape their mouths shut. This movie does not deserve such a high rating.
Coppola's best work. Marvelous actors and great atmosphere.
This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
The godfather is the pinnacle of movies,its flawless with an absolutely amazing performance by Marlon Brando, the godfather is the godfather of movies, forever a classic that changed cinema
Ts my first ever movie iam watching with a huge mob fro my college the experience about this movie is not able to complete by few wprds or sentenses, this is the milestone of my movie watching, i still adore amd like such types of classic hits!each scenes worthful for the audiece.
The Godfather is the one movie that I can say as a kid...I want to do that when i grow up!
This is one of the best movies ever made. It's simply brilliant with some of the best actors of Hollywood. Watching this is a must. You won't regret it.
The Godfather is my favourite and the best movie for. I've watched it over and over for so many times. It showed me the reality aspect out of those ideal heroic epics. It taught me how to be a truely good son, boyfriend or person. It's such a masterpiece.
"I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
This is one of a kind. The acting is perfect. Al Pacino's character goes from a kind hearted man to a man with hardly any heart at all and I love it. The music is amazing sounding like something you would hear at Epcot in the Italy section. The only reason I rated this a 9 and not a 10 is because the beginning is a little slow but it starts moving faster and faster to where it becomes an compelling crime drama.
A film that brings us the fullness of the time. When I watched it for the first time, it was as if I was visualizing a time, a family, a veritable simplicity in the details of each word of the actors. I always like to review it for feeling these things. You can even smell the blood!
Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, "The Godfather" is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made.

Everyone please don't read reviews of The Godfather.Just watch this masterpiece. No words to describe.
I don't care if it's not in the first place on the list... The Godfather is the best movie ever made. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando played their roles perfectly and the plot is marvelous. It is a great representation of one world of mafia and underground. If you love movies you have to love it.
The Godfather is regarded as a masterpiece and classic and I ain't denying that. The only thing that makes this a 6 for me is the phasing most Scene felt really dragged out. However I liked the movie and think people should see as long as you're not really inpatient. 6.8/10

When you want to see a good movie, you have to see this one. The script, the actors, just whole the film is incredible. It takes about three hours but it's done before you know. Everyone I know loved it, and I know many people.
Just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an
It's nice but not that great either. I think it was liked by famous actors.
The god father movie is a gangster movie. hide spoilers
Few words required to review the first of the trilogy. Classic is predictable however the most appropriate. I personally prefer Pacino's performance in this one, many will prefer part two. Masterful performance from Brando and if Jimmy Caan was ever better I'd like to know. Great story, Great acting and Great direction I can't say anything that's not been said before. But I can confirm.

I mean come on... I have watched the movie for the first time as an adult in 2020 at 34 years old. I have seen so many better films. I don't get all the reviews, it's like they all belong in the past. I see nothing great in this movie.
Amazing script, flawless from the opening scene to the end, great development of personalities, epic performance for Alpacino and Marlon Brando ,you gotta love the italian gangster after this movie One of Coppola's finest art
I like the part when the guy says "let them lose their souls" :)

This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
The Godfather is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. I love the opening sequence. The drama and the crime is what really makes this movie phenomenal.
The play of Godfather only follows one formula, that is, the classic mode of power passing on from generation to generation.

The structure of the story is very delicate, and the plots echo each other. The irony of the film's title is that it ultimately refers not to the father, but to the son. At the beginning of the film, Michael not only didn't get involved in the family business, but also planned to marry Kay Adams, a Protestant high-class American. Later, he saved his father's life by moving his father's bed in the hospital, and whispered in the ear of the comatose old man: "I'm with you now." From then on, his life took another road.
It is not just a mafia movie.It has an idea of family and being together under mafia cover
It is not just a mafia movie.It has an idea of family and being together under mafia cover
The film gave me a very different feeling. Splitting the "Godfather" apart, each small piece is actually bland, but when these bland small pieces are combined together, they produce such a huge magic force. Real emotions are the foundation, there is no pretentiousness, no exaggeration. Just like our real life, people are very sensitive to reality.

It's hard to make a movie that doesn't bother the viewer at all, but the high power shakes the viewer. All I can say is that it doesn't diminish the appeal of this film
I did not like it to much it was good but not The best
Just « Don Al Pacino »

It's a movie you have to look in your life,

Script 10/10 Acting 10/10.
One of my best. it add some kind of classification in my life. thanks
This movie is one of my best. it add to my life some kind of classification

Great movie ! One of the best ever , excellent acting .

Godfather is the best movie of all time and it's perfect in everything. It's very well detailed. But for me it seems to be slow and there are less goosebumps.


I enjoy it, it is the best movie in the world, i like it , I love it
The great movie one of the best mafia movies that ever made
The Godfather movies are the masterpiece. This movie is taught in most film schools throughout the world. Michael Corleone as the main character in the GF is a rich and three-dimensional character who is principled in facing arcs throughout the story. There is an amazing flow in the storytelling of GF and the story world is very nicely well established. At the end of the story all the stories are well connected and there are answers for all questions established in the beginning of the story.
Totally blown away. Absolute masterpiece one of the best films ever made!!!!
Very interesting characters/character development. Impressive how a Marlon Brando in his 40s could portray a senior so realistically.

A lot of iconic scenes!
This is not just movie, it is an emotion. The dialouges are very comfortable. the acting level is incomparable.

I am teenager and I watched this movie to being honest i not that amuse with it but after gather up some knowledge I watched it and then I appreciate it found lot more meaning and perfection in this movie.i have to watch it many to totally appreciate it.
In addition to watching the film I also read his novel, what I find interesting in this story is how a twelve-year-old child survived the mob run, until he could become a businessman and a mob leader
This movie made me an offer I couldn't refuse.
When I first saw this movie I was 15 years old and I liked it so much that since then I have watched it like 15 times. the performances and soundtrack are very good. the other two films in the trilogy are also good but don't beat the first. if you like the genre of gangsters you have to see this classic
The best of best. It is my favroite movie. Many of my friends said it is not good but I like this style movies and I think it is the best one. This movie is not only about crime but also shows us what is the family and what is loyality.


The Godfather is the best trilogy movies I've ever watched.
Everything about is really great the soundtrack, the story, and everything, 100 out of 10.

One of the best movies ever made!! This is a classic.
A very exciting drama with a very interesting story, wonderful acting and wonderful special effects that embody the meanings of pain, love, care, the meaning of (the end) for every human being in this world and his written destiny for him.
This one is absolutely amazing. This movie is rated diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting , enticing and thought provoking. It established new benchmarks for American cinema.

I had never seen the godfather til a month ago the reason i saw this was because everyone who has seen it said it was a masterpiece. This you probably don't care but when i saw it they were right this was by far my favorite movie. If you like mafia movies, or liked the movie snatch you will love this movie. Even though it is 3 hours long it still seems like it's to short. There is nothing in this movie i hated and believe me it's an offer you can't resisce.

I have one word, this movie is a masterpiece. remains a reference for anyone loves make movies!

Amazing movie picture! I advise everyone to watch. A wonderful storyline, American cinema, as always, surprises with a masterpiece. Emotions are still after the movie!
The most outstanding of all time, a cult film about the Sicilian mafia and its head - Vito Carleone (played by Marlon Brando). A film based on Mario Puzo's book of the same name, directed by Francis Coppolo (who became a great Hollywood director thanks to the film).

Sometimes the ingenious play of the actors and the genius of the efforts of the director himself, even from a fairly primitive mafia film, can make a masterpiece for all time, which will disperse into winged expressions, memes... No more than a dozen such crime dramas as "The Godfather" have been filmed in the entire history of cinema, which once again confirms the luck of everyone who created this outstanding film.
I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
Its definitely worth all the hype, i would suggest if you have a bucket list of movies, watch it. I watched it maybe about 5 years ago, with my friends, there is a reason why its been parodied to death and paid homage so many times over the years.
What more can be said? Watch this film and see how wonderful it is. Every scene stunningly brilliant, and memorable, from dialogue, to characterization and even down to the smallest detail.

There is nothing that could be said that is wrong about this movie. If you've not seen it yet, you're missing out on the movie that all movies that have been made since it have wanted to be, and could never possibly out do (with the exceptions of Parts II and III).

10 out of 10.
Every scene is a work of art with some of the best casting and acting ever. Marlon Brandon best film and best character in film ever don vito corleone.

One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
Personal opinion this is the greatest film ever made. Not much to say, it is the absolute movie experience. Everyone should enjoy this old time classic. Needless to say it never gets old!
I did not know what art was until I was introduced to this love poem. Even better than the book. Godfather represents the history of America's immigration. In other words: a história da minha família.
The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and that's fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesn't give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you don't doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. It's such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow.

Such a classic, I watch it over and over and I find more things I missed the last time.

It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.

honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! i would've enjoyed it more if it was shorter. i really don't get how its one of the most talked about movies of all time. i rated it 5 after watching but i'm giving it a 3 now. and i'm pretty sure i'm never gonna complete the second and third films.
I never grow tired of this motion picture, with its brilliant dialogue, its powerful characters, and its impeccable direction. This is one of the greatest films of all time, and will likely remain as such forever. Absolutely timeless.
This is a good film. It is well directed and well acted. The story is engaging, and the sets flawlessly reflect the time period. And yet... it is only a *good* movie. I know that I will probably be hated for saying this, but "The Godfather" really doesn't seem like a masterpiece. Although it is certainly one of the most influential films of its time, I can't help but feel that it is a little overrated. Perhaps my tastes just aren't the same as everyone else's. And then again... maybe I am right, and a film doesn't have to be "perfect" to be memorable. "The Godfather" is worth watching... once... mainly because it has become such an integral part of our culture. It set the stage for epic crime dramas, and that alone is impressive. But... is it really so much better than other films? The first doesn't always have to be the best. "The Godfather" lays down a very solid foundation for future cinema, much as "Gone With the WInd" did, way back in the day (don't even get me started on that one). It is by no means perfect, but it is, like I said, worth watching.
I have nothing against this movie honestly... i could just never get into it long enough to stay awake.
this movie was horrible i don't understand how this is a good movie. Al Pacino's worst movie. Marlon Brando was horrible. So many people say how good this is but i think this movie should be burned. Francis ford Coppola is a bad director. Goerge Lucas is the best director ever. I'd give this movie a 3.0 on a 10 scale. The best movie in the world is easily material girls. Hilary duff is so hot in that movie. The screen play was bad the acting was bad and the director was bad. A movie you should see is Material girls the best movie ever. Good directing screenplay and defiantly acting. Another good movie was From Justin to Kelly. Justin is hot in his swimsuit but Kelly needs to lose pounds.


This is a masterwork of a film. Completely and absolutely the greatest movie ever created. In fact, it is so incredibly perfect, I don't even need to go any further. Nothing went wrong. Rent, buy, see it. No matter how, it's eternally enjoyable. There is no more quotable, or enjoyable film. Anywhere.
I watch this movie with pops often. we have all the family watching
No one ever after. It not only become a close to human film, still make it true posterity elegance! Great works! Worth use lifetime to enjoy reason! Great father, great little son! The combination of these factors how can not moving? This is the true human place! This is the unparalleled great work! You made a great magic! You are amazing works, are always! Do you still remember the inside of the magical plot. The moving scenes? Those who let you shed tears of plot? The younger perfect calm temperament! Old godfather of my hero ecru? Yes! This is the godfather! Magical great works 。I'll remember where the characters! Thank the director and actors
The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic.
Godfather amazing movie , i am 19 years old and i so much like this movie, with absolutely the best actor Marlon Brando ! Maybe i'm young but i know what quality and excellent movie . I think that never make movie like this , because this is the best movie ever. Amazing qutoes : "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." "You sonofabitch, do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders." "Whatya gonna do? Nice college boy, eh? Don't wanna get mixed up in the family business? Now you wanna gun down a police captain because he slapped you in the face a little bit, huh? Whataya think this is, the Army, where you shoot 'em a mile away? You gotta get up close like this... badaBING! you blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit. C'mere... you're taking this very personal." "She was beautiful! She was young. She was innocent. She was the greatest piece of ass I ever had, and I've had'em all over the world!"
Have you seen this movie? If you have, then you most likely have no reason why to question my rating of this movie as 10 out of 10. This movie is the greatest film of all time. As millions of people before me have said, anyone who has seen Goodfellas, Casino, or any other numerous well-made mob movies, this movie is the inspiration for those films, and if this movie had not been made, those films would not have existed. In short, you can't call yourself a film buff if you have never seen this film, or maybe you can't call yourself a film buff if you don't own this film.
Hello.

The Godfather is by far the greatest film I have ever seen! This is a truly unique film, and even after decades of attempts, nobody has come close to making a film like this, and will fail to do so because of its rawness and authenticity. There are many films which may just about come close to its entertainment, but not many that add up to its power, emotion, schooling, and culture. I cannot think of one element missing in this film. Extraordinary!

Thank you very much,

Afollabi El-Sheikh Al Noor Mohammed
Uh, this is the masterpiece of the film industry. I see this movie 100 times, and I'll see it again. I don't know when another movie will be something like Godfather. All actors do the job perfectly, and the whole film have the brilliant story witch end push to the next part.
Marlon Brando, Al Pacino need I say more!

Totally an amazing film by Mr Francis Ford Coppola. I watched it once and was left sat there amazed at how good a film it was as i cryed out for more. No other gangster film is as good although Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction are very close.

It leaves other gangster films sleeping with the fishes.
Well i have seen the movie first before reading the book and i must say that Francis Coppala has done an excellent job to the movie. Everything in it is so realistic, it simply goes on and on. Well this is an absolute great movie.
A masterpiece of film making that took me 2 years to persuade my wife to see !! We sat down one evening to watch it and she was immediately hooked. We then spent the next 2 evenings watching 2 & 3... 3 a little disappointing mainly for Sophia's pathetic acting skills. The finale when she finally cops it was worth the wait though. How on earth Al Pacino did not win an Oscar for his performance is astonishing. Do try to watch them on DVD great film, deserves great quality... Can't wait to see it on the big screen one day...Here's hoping.
This movie is a Master Peace. Suspense action drama murder money power loyalty respect fear ambition revenge rage I mean what more can you ask for in a movie . All Star cast . Need I say more
You simply run out of superlatives when attempting to describe the Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather, its simply incredible. With one of the best cast lists of all time,(Marlon Brando Al Pacino James Caan Richard S. Castellano Robert Duvall John Cazale Sterling Hayden John Marley Richard Conte Diane Keaton)and the awards this film has won, its easy to understand why The Godfather is considered by many, The greatest film ever made. This film seems nail the balance of action, awesomeness and damn right brilliance. From the 'Horse Head on the pillow' scene to the 'Opening Scene' of Marlon Brando, this film just oozes with awesomeness! With all considered this film is simply phenomenal and its easy to see why its a permanent landmark in American cinema
At first i tough this movie will be a boring one. but after watching it ... it give me a gosebump... the storyline so good .. it makes me know how cruel the world back then
One of the best quality trilogies ever, maybe the best. When I first watched this movie, I questioned why I watched it so late. The acting is great, the production is great. In short, everything is great. Great movie.
Absolute masterpiece, Marlon brando's finest work as Vito. Truly iconic scenes swell.
A masterpiece, a truly amazing performance from probably the greatest actors of all time: Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The acting is flawless, the story is superb and the director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a genius.

A fascinating movie that I'm sure everyone should love; the tragic way in which Michael Corleone is transformed in a powerful Mafia leader who shows no mercy to anyone in order to keep his family "in business"

The movie is 3 hours long, but you will be so caught in the action, you won't even notice the time passing by. This is a movie that you can watch once or twice a year without getting bored. I watched it probably 20 times, and every time i watch it I love it more and more... My advice is: Watch This Movie! (if you haven't done that already)
If this is not a 10, what film qualifies for a 10?

Godfather is one of the best movies i've ever seen, the plot in the movie is perfect and the story thrilling and fantastic. The actors perform extraordinary good and there isn't one bad thing about the movie. It is totally worth seeing and is a experience just to watch, when i saw i was left with a feeling of some of the best spend time in my life, the movie is earned 10 stars and has deserved a place on the top 250, and it's well deserved that the movie is placed at the 2nd place, because this masterpiece of a movie is one of the best movies ever made and because the actor play the roles and perform flawless. I will advise everyone who haven't seen it yet just to go home sit on the crouch and watch it, because this is a fantastic movie!!!

Of course, a million movies imitate all the superficial aspects, the mafia stuff that's become cliche, but they don't really try to make a movie like THE GODFATHER. Maybe they're just being realistic - not many people could pull off a movie that good. But still. Let's see some striving, people. True greatness has been proven possible. You'll never get it unless you try.
I watched The Godfather for the first time on DVD the other day and was simply blown away from the very start. It had a quality that no other film has and much of this is accomplished by the brilliance of the director, Francis Ford Coppola, and actors Marlon Brando and the astonishing performance of Al Pacino, who many doubted at the time. All great films require a great beginning and this one had, in my opinion, the best yet with the very first line, 'I believe in America', and then the very slow draw back of the camera to reveal The Godfather (Brando). I was worried for Al Pacino at the start of the film whether he would be shadowed out of this movie by the brilliance of Brando, but all doubt quickly went from my mind after watching him in the restaurant scene. The way that he sat there so calmly to the people he was talking to but to the audience he built up an incredible amount of tension. This was important for him to do this because this part of the film was the defining moment of this characters transition, from not wanting to be involved at the start and now he is doing his fathers job personally.
I think this movie is part of real life That can be a story for people to tell among friends A story in which there is excitement, advice, pride and honor.
This movie is like a wine, the more getting old the more getting better and better and better.... This is in my opinion the best movie ever made, the cast, the story the music, the directing, everything is perfect...
A pretty good underworlds drama... Presenting us with a very good picture of the inside world of the Italian mafia and their activities in Italy (Sicily) and the USA (New York and various other places).

One on the best castings I have seen, great cast and crew.

The cinematography is also great, an outstanding job from the creators.

The script is very well redacted glamourising crime and also keeping family traditions as part of their codes and with the help of the actors it comes alive beautifully.

Coppola's greatest directing movies, a must seen movie, actually a saga of movies to enjoy for filmmakers and movie followers.


This movie is truly a classic, not for the action mind you for there are a lot of movies around with this kind of action in it. But none have the mind biting dialogue in them. This movie is like eating a chocolate cake. One bite and your hooked, truly I must say this is a great film, the cast is brilliant. I loved Marlon Brando as the godfather but I think Al Pacino and James Caan did wonderful jobs as well I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves mafia films, it's truly one of a kind I would also like to point out that James caan still has it that kind of Mafia mojo of course it was used really well in Micky Blue eyes which just happens to be the funniest Mafia film I have ever seen.
One of the greatest films of all time. MUST Watch for all generations.
It's alright, but I was expecting much better. Maybe I'll look back at this review in a few years time and kick myself for not getting 'the greatness' of this film. It just isn't as gripping as a film like goodfellas. I had to force myself to keep watching, but as it went on, it was less of a drag. A lot of good quotes that I actually have started to use to be fair to it
this movie has action its an okay movie, on the count of a few actors but most of the actors are good play rollers who take there part and do what they got to do. mean while others do not and just don't care that much. this movie had a lot of enthusiasm, action, adventure, and its based on an old time mafia gang. which is practically why so many people rate so high. its an amazing story based on 5 tribes who want power over the whole city. there is a wise tribe, aggressive tribe, smart tribe, poor tribe, and a rich tribe. these five families have different ways of surviving and gaining trust over the other 4.due to an overwhelm of one taking to much land it causes trouble. so that's when the action begins to happen. so i would highly recommend this movie to all who want to watch it or just want to know what its about.
This in my opinion is the top of must watch list. The drama, the story-line, the twist, and everything about it sets the benchmark of movies of today.

This can't be just a film. Stars should align to make such a product. Nothing more can be said. One can not be told who The Godfather is, you have to see it for yourself.
ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIE MADE. MARLON BRANDO AS THE DON, REMARKABLE WORK !!!!

Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, "The Godfather" An intricately constructed tapestry of narrative, emotion and the trials of a reluctant gangster.
Fabulous, it's talking about the orgnized crimes, it processed this in the most dramatic way!
One of the best movie I have ever seen in my life.. #Done
My favorite movie of all-time! every single scene is a myth.. perfect cast and a remarkable story..! once I watched the first movie I couldn't stop till I finished the triology
Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael,

Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a "godfather" or "don," the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by
First film that got me into the Gangster category. Would highly recommend anybody to watch this whether you're in film studies or getting into the filmmaking trade or just a general movie nut.

Definite watch!
A great movie and great acter and great directer a love this movie
Upon finding the Godfather (1972) at #175 on the all time US voters list of the greatest films of all time - I simply laughed...

No sign of Godfather II, which is cognitively greater than it's predecessor. Do these people have any critical ability! If The Godfather is, in my humble, in the top ten ever (and I struggle to better it - exception of it's sequel), then I am full of dismay... GII is the best film ever made... Contrast the moment Michael finds that Fredo has betrayed him with the moment DiCaprio & Winslett stand on the bow of the Titanic... no contest methinks. Come on USofA, get a grip... Your current President (George W Bush) exhibits the same lacklustre approach as did the one that bailed out of Cuba in '58. Spineless... Again... Even in your thoughts, USofA - I love the taking the mickey out of the spineless...

rob (a fan of Mr Vonnegut)
Such an iconic piece of art .It's like classic Italian mob documentary narrated by the people within the story. Totally understood the enormous pressure during the production of this film as it's realism nature eventually changed how movies are made.
The Best Drama Movie ever . the acting and performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino was Amazing
This is with out a doubt one of the most beautifully made gangster films in history.the acting was simply amazing and mesmerizing .the script and directing were one of the most brilliant and iconic in the film industry! Francis Ford Coppola did a remarkable job.for me it is a 10 out of 10 and a must see.
This film is amazing and is a must watch. Any one who may have seen goodfellas may like this also.
A band of mostly Italian American sociopaths terrorize each other and local businesses aided by corrupt law enforcement, courts, and crooked elected officials. Still one of the best movies ever made if not the best.

A film masterpiece:a dramatic gangster movie that deals with power, karma, true love. Photography wise, content wise, and music wise it's an absolute classic
When best Thechnisians meet best artist the result will be GOD FATHER ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE WATCHED IN MY LIFE. The way story was narrated given goose bumps,the way characters narrated was extraordinary Dialouges of the film was quite interesting when you look for the best to watch you cant get more than this Watch and enjoy Well written,Well directed,Well acted


The Godfather shows character development extremely well and the minimal action in the film is engaging but the film overall is convoluted and dull. I personally wouldn't put this in a top 100 list but maybe I'm missing something.
I believe that families were so close to that fire where nobody makes it back that it almost completely destroyed the notion of old time family powers that reigned the streets, and not only streets but politics as well. This picture is about making a choice that neither of them bode well. Grand Picture.
I never saw it like I thought it was a gangster movie. I saw how wrong I was.
I never saw it like I thought it was a gangster movie. I saw how wrong I was. G.O.A.T movie. al pacino is genius
The Godfather is a great movie that innovated the crime genre. It has a great story which (for a nearly 3 hour movie) moves quickly. We are brought close to the professional and personal lives of these mafia men, and when we see some of them gunned down, it's relatively hard-hitting. This was an innovation at the time: for a mafia film to bring us emotionally close to the characters. Perhaps the most shocking scene in the film (not to spoil anything) ends with a car riddled in machine gun bullets. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone can be seen as one of the most iconic performances/roles in film history: it is Brando transformed, and he's fun to quote back to. Like any movie that is labeled with such a "legendary" status, The Godfather is a tad overrated; but still very good nonetheless thanks to it's great story, performances, and iconic scenes.
Monumental. The best of its kind and the apex for both Coppola and Pacino. A must see.
Maybe the greatest movie ever. The first one is more special i think cause of Brando. Every time i see it i enjoy it the same!
Truly an original, powerful, loving story that will never die.

Its a kind of movie that you can not replace it, you can replace it with only another two parts🙂

I know many people do not care for this movie, however it quickly became one of my favorites. The actors gave these characters special meanings and helped to make the "criminals" more "likable" in my opinion. This movie is one of my "go to" choices when I am looking for something more familiar to watch and I honestly can view it every view days with no problem. If you are looking for a "mafia" movie that also spends time showing some of the family connections, than this movie is for you.
The Godfather is the best work of F.F. Coppola and the best mafia movie that you can find, the actors, music, atmosphere, decoration, script, everything in this movie is great and unforgettable! so if you still haven't watched the movie, you should grab your popcorn and get ready to 3 hours of pleasure!

The general synopsis of this film without making a huge SPOILER is that there are a bunch of gangsters who are trying to take over NYC. They have a lot of fights between themselves and they end up in lots of tension. The tension is so real that you'll have to brace yourself and have REGULAR intermissions to take an emotional break from the violence. The ONLY spoiler I will reveal is that, let me tell you, you're in for a wild ride. If you are into gore, this is a wonderful, wonderful feature length film and I would highly recommend it. Especially if you are into the classic varieties of films like myself, the ones from the era of transition into color televisions that allow for a much more real and vivid experience!
THIS MOVIE IS A WORK OF ART. Everything in this is perfect: perfect direction, perfect script, perfect actors, perfect music, perfect photography, it's just perfect. With this film it was discovered Al Pacino who makes an incredible character. I also think it's one of the most realistic movies I've seen since it's based on the Italian mafia and a character is constantly dying, more than one death can make you cry. And it's realistic because unfortunately that happens in reality. What else can I say about this movie: it is simply PERFECT.

O Poderoso Chefão é sem dúvidas o Maior Divisor de Águas do Cinema Americano!
Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all "gangster movies" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a "Jewish Godfather"; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an "Oriental Godfather"; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a "modern day Godfather."
A complete movie A masterpiece in the world of cinema And legendary actors ...!

Movie translates from the book perfectly Watch this movie and enjoy it!

Undoubted 10/10.
Yes, this film is most definitely positively something id watch again and again and again.
One of the greatest ang related movie. Al Pacino's and Marlon Brando's acts are amazing.

Probably the best movie ever made. This kind of movies you can watch over and over without getting bored

Mario himself didn't realize he was writing the greatest movie of all time until he further inquired about being a movie writer and the first book he read stated "go study godfather 1"
Blockbusters starcast and a blockbusters movie..a classic movie you can watch again and again..
The Godfather will have you wanting to watch more. It will have you on your toes. Its such a good movie your not going to want to move at all.
"Godfather" is really perfect , we have no better than this movie and you should watch it more than 1000000000 times!

This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
One of the greatest movies ever made. Great acting, superb story, great music, and visually stunning. I have seen this movie about five times and it never gets old.
Loved this movie! Such a great story line. Highly recommend!
Timeless! A masterpiece of cinematography, that encompasses almost all branches of human sentiment in real life situations. This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.
Arguably the best motion picture ever made along with Godfather Part II. Brilliantly acted, sensational scripts, holds up with time. 9/10
The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. A good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!
Wonderful story!!!! I think that older movies have better stories and personally this is one of the greatest stories of all time.
This movie sets the bar so high that it's nearly unreachable. Legendary timepiece that never gets old
Probably my favourite film ever made since it perfectly represents what happens in reality in the country of Italy, where i'm from. The film is dark, real , sublime, poetic. Happy to be italian an never offend an Italian's family it's not worth it.

This is the only film that touches me to such an extent that I am no longer myself. When I watch this, I watch it back to back with Part 2, and I feel like I am a member of the family; a family not of criminals, but of humans. Immerse yourself - feel human.
Hands down, The Godfather is the best picture ever made, in my opinion. The Godfather II is also a great film, and so is Citizen Kane. Hollywood, in its heyday, made some incredibly classic films, which makes it rather difficult to choose which ones are best. I have chosen The Godfather. Have watched it many times, and it never fails to keep me interested and entertained.
The Godfather is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen.

It has been criticised in the past for its violence, and I will agree, it isn't a film for children. But compare its violence to the gross and tasteless violence of many horror movies and you'll see it's there for a reason; a life of crime is a violent one. Crime, the Mafia, isn't really what this film is about though. It just provides the situation and events to tell a story about a family. It is the family that really moves you about this film. It is the love that he has for his family that redeems Vito Corleone. He does what he does for his family. The relationship between Vito, his wife and his children is so strong, they would kill for each other. "The Godfather" truly is beautiful. Francis Ford Coppola's style is so unflashy that it is as if he is just photographing the scene. There are no clever, "arty" camera angles. It just adds to the majesty of the film. The acting is breathtaking. Al Pacino's portrait of Michael Corleone is brilliant. I don't want to give any of the plot away, but please, please, for your own sake, see this movie!
I've seen this movie so many times. It's my absolute favorite movie. Always has been, always will be. A lot of people make the mistake of calling it a crime movie, but it really isn't. It's about so much more like family, and loyalty, and values you can get from it and all. It's just the best movie.
The Godfather is probably the greatest movie ever made. It combines astonishing acting by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but it also has one of the most captivating stories ever told. There aren't many movies where you feel sorry for the bad guys when something bad happens to them. I especially like the way that Frances Ford Coppela makes you feel like part of the Corleone family. This movie has some of the most memorable scenes in it. Who can forget the horse's head, or the bullet riddled Sonny lying in the middle of the road? This movie definitely deserves repeat viewings, along with its sequels.
Probably the third best crime/mafia movie ever behind Godfather II and Goodfellas. Still how could you possibly say Al Pacino as Michael is not excellent. What a casting ensemble, Pacino, Brando, DuVall, Caan, Cazale--very hard to top that. 10!!
This is quite possibly the most perfect movie ever made. The cinematography, the acting, the screenplay; all first rate. This is the most quoted and emulated movie that has ever been and will ever be made.
Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece features Marlon Brando in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime family and his efforts to hold up his empire. Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall gave a career making perfomances.It's a great movie even though Coppola and Mario Puzo made the criminals look beatiful despite their ugly crime business.
I've always thought of the Godfather as a family film a king with 3 sons the eldest given his courage, the next his cool head and calmness and the youngest his wit and innocence. Except with this family film the family members are murderers and thieves.
There are very few films that can completely hold the viewers attention for their entire duration, and even fewer that are nearly 3 hours long, yet The Godfather manages to do exactly this. It is wonderfully acted and directed, with stand out performances from Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Al Pacino.

It charts the rise and fall of the Corleone Mafia family in New York from the 1950's, and manages to give a believable insight into what it may be like to be a member of the mafia and to not trust anyone.

Once you have seem this film you will understand why it won Best Picture at the oscars.


Yeah, yeah. It's a fine movie. Overlong, but that's only because of the pleasingly languorous pacing. Still, it ain't as good as everybody makes it out to be. And can anybody justify casting Marlon Brando, James Caan, John Savage, and Robert Duvall as the brain-trust of an Italian mob family? (Thank God for Pacino.) The casting director should have been made to sleep with the fishes.
This movie is not 10/10 or the greatest ever made. Firstly this movie would have been made under 1 hour 30 minutes, most of scenes are just wasting time. Secondly I don't understand why people like this. Is it because of cast or there was no movie like that in 1972. Finally I just want to say this movie is completely overrated. NEVER believe these overrated reviews and comments.
what a load of hogwash.absolute tripe typical American rubbish.overrated.bad acting you name it was there.give me will hay any day.why people watch this trash ,i don't know.Marlon Brando,whats he talking about,he justs mumbles.give me a British actor anyday.let me sum up and say this is the worst film,i have ever seen.i hope to god i never see it again.i have been watching movies for thirty years and this is just the worst movie i have seen.it typifies what is wrong with the movie industry,when they can waste money on overblown claptrap such as this.if this is the best Hollywood can offer,god help us.lets just hope it was just a blipand Hollywood can again start making decent movies.
The Godfather was in 1973 a masterpiece and it still is and always will be. This movie is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made.

The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 45 years after its release. This movie has become a huge part of popular culture. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory. I can watch it over and over again with great pleasure....
One of the best trilogy made till date. Despite the slow move of the movie sequences it catches the attention of the viewer. A better way to represent the DON families of that time.


I saw The Godfather at least seven or eight times before I read the original Mario Puzo novel. While the movie reached me on several levels, I never quite understood why. Then I read the book: I was stunned. I don't know the exact contribution Coppola made to the screenplay (both he and Puzo are credited), but in some scenes the actors were reading Puzo's original lines direct. And with good reason: they simply couldn't be bettered.

Clearly, the entire cast had studied the book well; I admired the way they subtly wove in much of the character development explicitly dealt with in the book but (largely) left out of the screenplay: Sonny's warm-heartedness and genuine brotherly love for Michael; Luca Brasi's monstrous reputation; Don Corleone's tendency towards peasant simplicity; and on it goes. I urge those of you who have seen and admired the movie but who have not yet read the book, get hold of a copy; surely no other movie bears quite this relationship to the novel that preceded it.
Between the incredible story, superb acting and a musical score 2nd to none this is the one all others should be measured by. No one has done it better before or since. Coppola mastered, under incredible pressure, not only the interpretation of a best selling novel, but he was brave enough to fight for his casting choices. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan and Cazale were never better or even equal to their performances in "the Godfather". Pacino fans may say "Scarface" was more of a tour de force, but to see the subtle change in Michael Corleone from pacifist war hero to cold-hearted killer is acting at it's finest. I have recommended "The Godfather" to a number of 20-something friends trying to imagine what their reactions would be. To a person, all have sung it's praises, proving the everlasting quality of "The Godfather".
Two words, absolutely perfect. A few more words: The Godfather is (almost) the only movie that has not a single weakness. Perfect acting, perfect cast (Coppola, who wanted Pacino badly), perfect script. Simply the best. Better then all the rest.
Magnifico, very magnifico, truly magnifico, always magnifico, never-ending magnifique.
I just think that this is the best movie ever made. Screenplay is exellent, acting is brilliant, and directing is very good and without any mistakes. The best part of the movie is (first part, of course) is beginning, and the part when Michael Corleone is on Sicilia, when he met his future wife... However, The Godfather should get much more Oscars then three of them, and that is the only thing I don't like, but...

The movie is great, and I reccomend to everyone who didn't seen it...
Forget the violence & crime. At the heart of this film is a story about family and the bond between family members. This is probably the greatest soap ever made. It is so easy to forget what a great actor Marlon Brando was. Fortunately we do not have to rely on Superman to be a testament to his skill. This film together with On the Waterfront & A Streetcar Named Desire are a more accurate tribute to his skill. I believe there are few books or films which really stand up to being seen repeatedly, this together with the book is one of them.
The Godfather,1972, is the movie by which other mob classics are compared to. Although not categorized as a "Mob Movie", it is what all other mob movies are compared to. the story is great, the acting unsurpassed. By the time the movie ends you are rooting for the "bad guys", the Corleone family. Other great movies such as Goodfellas, Casino, Bugsey etc. are good, fun and entertaining, these latter movies show the lower level mobster, whereas the Godfather shows what life is like if you are on the top of the syndicate ladder. Keep in mind that as great as this movie is in real life the mob's retirement plan isn't all that great!!
It gets a 10 because it deserves a 10. Not as perfect as Rear Window, but better than Lord of the Rings. We'll see if Lord stands the test of time. If we were comparing books....I'd say Lord was better, but because we're comparing movies...Godfather reigns.
One of the greatest mob movies ever made. i wish they had 11 stars instead of just 10. i can't wait to see the next one in series.

This movie is my favorite all the times.I have seen its all three parts repeatedly.
One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
What a movie, the godfather of all movies for ever!! I love this movie, the plot, the actors, everything. Al Pacino as a young boy starting to take his fathers place. The Italian customs, the cast. From the beginning tot the end: truly fantastic! I see this movie every year and it keeps getting better. Suspense, Humor, Action, Great Characters and so on. Greatest movie ever made! Of course the movie is part 1, part 2 and part 3. But I must say part 1 is my favorite part. Swichting form Sicily to America is brilliant. With my friends we recently had an Italian night, with Italian food and wines. Watching this movie we make jokes and start imitating the characters: "act like a man!" Hehe, great!
God father is the one of the best outstanding movie i have ever seen

This movie is the best movies, I have seen forever. I wish, someone make a series for these collection.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
As a 19 yr old watching this film recently for my first time I simply cant see this film continuing to be considered the best film of all time.

Yes the acting is good and the script is very smooth but there are large chunks of this film that can only be described as horribly boring

Nearly everyone I know in my generation agrees this is highly overrated so I think its only a matter of time before another film lifts it off top spot (hopefully Shawshank redemption - although return of the king is more likely)

4/10
Have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people
Marlon Brando is the head of the Corleone crime family. He is a family man, he is a loving man, and will protect his family at all cost. Even though the choices he makes to protect them puts HIM in much danger. After refusing to get involved in the dangerous drug business. The drug men try to kill him. He is helpless in the hospital. His sons take control of the family and they protect the family. His youngest son, who refused to get involve with his fathers business, takes the honors of retaliating against the people who tried to kill his father. Which changes the life of everyone in the family...And mostly him...Forever... What a Brilliant motion picture!
Great production. Great actors. Great actress. Terrific story line

I've watch thiis movie over a hundred times at least, and still it captures me.

It's a timeless epic movie, as simple as that.
The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art. As filmmaking and storytelling, 'The Godfather' remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons.
I watched this movie many times, and everything i conclued is that this movie is actually the best movie of all times. It's timeless movie, doesn't matter if it's 1972 producted. Definitely must watch.
There are no words to explain how good is this movie
I love this movie love love loveee and you bedes lon on it plzzzz
For me, this movie is definitely one of the best movies! 10*
The best gansta film of all time... go see it hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The best mob movie of all time. It teaches you what loyalty is and how to really keep your enemies close.

After watching it, I want to join the mafia. Do not regret spending 3 hours. Totally worth it!
I recently watched this film for the first time with my father. It was his choice, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy it nearly as much as I did!

Marlon Brando was an absolutely sublime Vito. Vito Corleone is possibly one of my all-time favourite fictional characters now.

I'm not an expert review-writer, but I just want to say that this film is unarguably one of the best films ever made, if not the best, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I wached many time.

Great actors, great director, everything is good in that movie.

Excelent job by Francis Ford Coppola.

I LOVE THIS MOVIE.
I was very late to see this one. But once I watched I got to know "Why" it's the Best . Actually it should be at the top.The music, writing, screenplay , dialogue everything is so perfect. I don't know few people say part-1 is better than the other two parts but for me all three parts were best as per the story was going, no doubt first godfather has some supreme actors that's the real fact that makes 1st part a bit edge to win.
Love this movie, It will always be one of my all time favorites and the style will always be a huge inspiration to me.
This is movie fantastic, because many fight and strong man. So you must wacht it!!
This movie have its own points that lead to conclusions!
there are no words to express the way i feel about this movie. watching it was like looking into the eyes of God, and knowing that i was his most glorious creation. i give this film a ten because it is one of the most incredible movies ever made, and because it is nothing short of perfection. the acting is superb to say the least, the directing is legendary. the sets were monumental. this is a film that should be shown to newborns as they break from the crest of there mothers womb, it should be the first sight they see. i salute every member of the crew, from the star actor right down to the guy who swept the floors after the last day of shooting.
If you haven't seen this movie yet than what are you doing in your life its a classic. go watch it now!
It shows what cinema art is and what cinema is not. The Godfather helps me to understand art better and i think it does its duty as good as possible. and i should say that this film shows golden ages of cinema too.
Very good movie, watched it about 3 times now. Love the characters and the plot, the cast did an amazing job with portraying the characters.
The Leidenfrost effect is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, close to a surface that is significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer that keeps the liquid from boiling rapidly. Because of this 'repulsive force', a droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with the hot surface.

This is most commonly seen when cooking, when a few drops of water are sprinkled in a hot pan. If the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, which is approximately
I love the fact that the movie give us an insight in something we would, as "normal" people, never get the chance to know. It's a world full of traditions, family values, rich and explicit verbal and behavior language, but also a world of corruption, power, deceit and murder. Francis Ford Coppola knows how to create this Italian-American feeling throughout the whole movie, and it never feels superficial. It's a very good movie, but not extra-ordinary. I lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son Michael being dragged into the world of the mafia. It was a bit too easy. He gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop, and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody. I think I miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic. Anyway, trying to keep The Godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre. I think that this great movie needs to get away from this forced spotlight position, so we can appreciate the film without all this hype. And we shouldn't be blind to other great cinematic pearls being made in recent years.
Godfather as the name suggests, is truly a godfather of all the movies in the same genres. From the excellent star casts to the fascinating directorial skills, It sums-up the whole experience and makes it a movie of a lifetime.
Very popular movie so probably not going to say anything new, but I will try to tell the main good things about this movie. So let's start with acting I guess and oh boy it is amazing. All the characters feel so real, dialogues are really deep and full of meaning. Plot also is very strong and interesting, you can watch this movie like over and over and not get tired of shown scenes, character dialogues. Movie always keeps you interested in what is going to happen, you don't want to miss a single detail because movie makes it just that much interesting. And last the music. Music choice in the movie is so good and fits scenes so well, I just can't express it, you just have to watch it, it stick in your head and fills it with something I can't express. Definitely give it a try.
Very Good! I liked it very much, the movie is awesome.
i start loving it when i play the game in ps2.then i start reading the novel and watch the movie.this is the first time i go crazy about a movie.i give 2 thumbs up 4 this movie and also 2 Mario Puzor who had created such a goo story about mafia in America....the best is the actor who really protre the character.the story line is imprasive.i like everything in the movie.godfather is such a big imfluance in those day.sometime i myself also imagine i'm like godfather rich everybody respect n care.the action in this movie really amaze me in every way.at the toll booth scene,i never expect that is a ambush.i think this movie is my all time favorite..
This is the best movie I have ever seen, watching again and again many times but still feeling intact, sincerely thank the author and director !
This is a very good movie that is very overrated. I agree that it belongs on the top 250 list, bust its rank as the best movie of all time is slightly overblown. It is a movie thats popularity has stemmed from the American fascination with the the Mafia.
Good movie but Petro Balbao better movie. thanks -kristot
This is a classic. I recommend it for everyone. Watched this movie in school for one of my class and since have watched it multiple times
The best movie ever ! The actors are amazing and the movie is a masterpiece !
A friend of mine and I were arguing as to the greatest film of all time and he sent me to this site to see what the idiots (all 250k of em) here had decided was the best pic. I of course (like anyone with sense and taste or knowledge of film) was extolling the unlimited virtues and impact of the REAL best picture of all time, Citizen Kane. He meanwhile was arguing for the Godfather and I just figured it was his immaturity or possibly his ignorance and then when told me to go to imfd id10t or whatever this site is I was ASTONISHED to find that there were a quarter of million other people who agreed. Habadashery!!! There could not have even been a "godfather" without Citizen Kane, ALL of modern film owes a debt of gratitude to that film and anyone who knows anything about film making knows this. Please refer to AFI or just ask any freshman student of film. Blasphemy! and everyone knows that Peewees big adventure is the foundation for the future of film./ HAHA.
Best movie ever I had saw in my life. First half was good. According to me the film was spectacular. Screenplay was excellent and cinematography was good.
Godfather is the name of most popular , classic , handsome movie of the all the time that produced
This the Godfather i watched it more than three times and still love this film I always suggest my people to watch this The Godfather is so influential movies of all time for me. it make me wanna watch more movie like this but it's so hard to find the film like this one this film is incredible CLASSIC
An outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers.
Great classic movie, one of the best in the history and master peice in cinema, Mafia italia

Overall an awesome movie. Acting was great the motion picture was awesome and the story line is amazing in itself!
The trilogy is an EPIC MOVIE. It depicts many real stories, real Sicilian family values, and what masterpiece truly is.

The greatest movie of all time everything was perfect in this movie , the action, the story, the direction and the look of the movie great work done by all cast and crew
Coppola's finest movie and arguably Pacino's finest performance. The high point of the 'New Hollywood'.
I have seen this film too many times and I always go back and back and back cuz I love it. loved this
Great movie also full discloure i have never watched this movie

Best classic movie ever, best narco, best Italian movie, best of the best

That was amazing movie i have ever seen! It has been a long time but I can tell one thing; This movie is a fantastic cult project in the world. And I can surely say more but enough. If you think you're unlucky of one in the world, take a look this lesson(The Godfather)

Amazing movie, its such a classic and a old movie but you guys are gonna love it when you will watching it
When I was little a didn't like it a lot...But after several years I watched it again and WoW ! From the beginning to the end it so interesting.Yeah I know it is old but this movie is so good that I doubt that soon we will see something as good as this.I watched it more than 20 times and every time I watched it with the same interest.The script was wrote so good but after its combined with actors its just perfect.I read and the book but we have to agree that this is the first time when the movie is better than the book.Why? Easy - when we read we have all in our head but here we see something which is better.There are a lot of good actors which did this. And Marlon Brando - speechless. This role was perfect played and it was perfect for him.Here just a perfect movie which is mixed of one time script , actors and unique soundtrack.
If you have never watched such movies, I would strongly recommend that you follow a very successful quality surely @alperenreis44

This movie really suprised me and I enjoyed it and it was really enyoible. But u could change a few things but its good
Okay so when I watched this film on Sunday before I had any idea what horrible pile of poop this was going to be, I thought too my self "this could be my favourite movie". Well it turned out to be nothing more then the most boring piece of flying poop I've seen in my life. The acting is mediocre at best and the pace of the movie never changes, its just slow slow slow. Jesus Christ, I really couldn't care if all of the actors died in the movie since I had absolutely no interest in it. The movie too me was so boring and bland that It took me over a week to watch it since its pace is incredibly slow and it never changes. The best part of the movie was when it showed the credits and ended, I said to my self "Thank god this fail is over" Quote on quote. Anyways to sum it up don't watch this over rated piece of icky buffalo poop that a skunk died on if you know what a good movie is.
Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history. The symbolism featured in the scene, such as the shiny body oil and the "you can't see me" hand gesture, is the best I've ever seen. By far the best movie I have ever seen.

I had heard about this movie (who hasn't really?) and I had a desire to watch this film. Yet, I couldn't because no one I knew had it, and I couldn't buy it. So, I decided to get the next best thing, and I read the book. I read the book in about a week, and I was astonished that such a book had existed and I hadn't read it before. So, my desire to watch the film was greater than it had ever been before. Finally, I was able to watch it. And, my God in Heaven. If I could, I would name my first born child Don Corleone (that's a joke) and make him look exactly like Marlon Brando. The acting, the writing, the directing, the cinematography, everything is fantastic. The only thing I can critique on is the action, and the fact that it was semi-cheesy. But, this is too be expected, as it was made in the early 70's, before great special effects. Despite this, I'd give this film 11/10.
I like it its good, good actors an everything is perfect

I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
Best movies ever in history, I am from Germany and I loved it, My name is Henning Weigand and I have watch this movie 100 time.
I love this movie. I can watch it over over again.


Great movie maybe a flawless one. I went in with expectation, I came out with the expectation's surpassed.
this is always the TOP.excellent movie in Hollywood industry .Pacino rocks.if anybody thinks this is a long one then they are not worth of seeing this movie.three and half hours of excellence in all including cinematography,screenplay,music and climax is awesome.nice movie of all times. its worth as it still in 2 ND place even after this long time . even though its from book, the way of expressing as movie is very very difficult which is excellently done by Francis ford Coppola. greatest movie of all time.and the second and third part of this movie are also nice movies .but first always stands first.its truly the masterpiece.as long as its length , there is no boring scene in this movie when compared to other long movies
The best all time marlon branda and al pacino best actors
I really adore this type of movies and i watched a lot of them but the godfather movie is an exception its soo much different how they build the characters the environment the story and the most amazing thing was the dialogue its just so great i cant even expect any movie in this period to compete with this piece of art

This is one of the best movies ever made. I've seen this and Godfather 2 over a dozen times! It's a timeless and perfect movie.
I thought three was the best of the pictures. This was second and the first was a little clunky. Great acting, great cast and decent cinematography. Storyline is three was the best, this was second best. The first Godfather was oky.
I'm not one to watch old movies because the quality bothers me, but this is worth it. Great movie.
"The Godfather" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made

Cool very very good movie this is probably my favourite movie amazing cool fantastinc tanzalizinly cool funny drama action comedy

I watched that movie like I read a brilliant book. The plot (despite its simplicity) keeps your interest up all along. So, one should not be discouraged by its length.

The director does a perfect job at dealing with the characters, not too cliché, not too bland. They are, with their fate, the ones triggering the watcher's feelings and anchoring his empathy which makes the movie so subtle. Even one who disdains any mafia romanticism could enjoy!

Finally, the outstanding quality of the photography smooths the watcher's entering in the story. He thus ends up wholly immersed in the story, until its very end.
In my opinion, this is definitely the greatest movie ever made!
Times are not the same, the road to go is not the same, talk about righteousness heavy family talk about the era of commitment.
It's The Godfather ffs. From all the crime movies this one is the best imo.And it surely deserves 10.Everything is amazing from story to characters.

This film is the best ever!. I have never watched a film so well produced!
I've seen a lot of movies but I don't think I'm very good at reviewing movies. I love movies that are bad for the majority of people and some movie was Overrated in my opinion. But I have to say that The Godfather surpasses every movie in the history of cinema. From the actors to the story, the the action and to the drama, The Godfather is just outstanding! This movie doesn't deserve the second place on IMDb top 250. It deserves the first place. If you have not seen this movie, I don't know what you were doing all the time because you are missing the greatest movie ever. Watch it NOW! Or I will make you an offer you can't refuse!

It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
This my father Goodfather. Movie vito corleone by its show. But almost all father good :)
This movie is a classic. It introduced a lot of up and coming stars. Definitely a movie that needs to be added to your catalog. The horse head in the bead is iconic
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The film features an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.


A Golden Era movie. Have been a die-hard fan of the entire series... There has been a little i can add to the reviews. Have seen many superb movies, but this is one is surely the every green Golden era movies. It keeps you connected.
This movie is the definition of overrated, it is incredibly slow moving, half of the movie is dark. very bored after 30 minutes of watching. incredibly overrated.
This film is excellent, everything in it works in perfect harmony, performances, soundtrack, editing, direction, I started to love cinema because of it.

The movie is wery good i watchet it a few time and its one of my favorit movies ever the movie it's just wel made.
Strangling in between the golden age of hollywood and new hollywood , a watershed moment in cinematic history . Watch this to truly know what " film " is . And watch it if you like paintings , as every frame in the movie is like a painting . And watch it countless times for countless reasons .

I heard about "The Godfather" a long time ago. But the reason I watched it for the first time is because of my English conversation class. My teacher is crazy about it. He asked us to write a movie thesis. The story itself is very exciting. But as a movie, to turn this story into a legend, you need a team of extraordinary play. Marlon Brando, as a veteran actor, blended the two roles of father and godfather very well, and very natural. His first appearance in the movie has completely conquered the audience. He is a unique godfather. Director: Francis Ford Coppola also arranged the story very well. Although this is a very long movie, I have no fatigue at all. The climax and calm of the story have very good rhythm and regularity. Music is also iconic. You may forget it briefly, but when you hear it again, you will immediately know it is "The Godfather".
I saw it first when i was a kid and understood nothin!... Watching after im 20,.. I found it as a masterpiece !!
So classical movie. Old godfather and young godfather are not only two generation, but also the support of the whole family.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
Till now The Godfather Movies counts in best movies. Really Awesome. When First time time watched it, just hooked with story.

Have seen this movies around 4-5 times. Still as good as new impact left on my mind.
The Godfather is an excellent movie with an excellent story. It is a film depicting the Sicilian mafia in USA as well as Italy itself, and is written by a person with direct Italian ancestry. ... The film had legendary actors like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall to mention a few.
Without a doubt one of the greatest and most important films EVER made. But one begins to think if its "timely values" still quite hold up in this day and age? I guess only more time and vengeance will tell.

The Italian church and the successful representative of the underworld in the United States and other capitalist countries in the world of flight, adventure, foothold, revenge, whitewash growth history, mixed knead the family, love, friendship under different circumstances and burst. Family interests above all, all against the growth and development of the family must be eliminated. The coexistence of interests is the basis of harmony, and the difference of interests is the beginning of hostility. When the old father dies, a new one is born. Is the beginning of the end which cannot be stopped.


Title says it all. yo. This movie is so boring. If you actually decide to watch this piece of **** you should contemplate purchasing a pair of noise canceling headphones and a blindfold. Seriously. I'm being super serious you guys. This movie is super annoying. Like seriously, remember that scene in Airplane where the women literally dies from boredom? That will be you son if you don't listen to me and decide to watch this movie. I'm trying to do you guys a favor. Would I really write all this sh*t if I didn't care about your well being? Also, by the way, if you pause at exactly 50:42 and scream "For the glory of Satan" you will get one million dollars. No kidding. Screw Peter Pan. That kid is so annoying. Like this movie.
How long does rewiev has to be to be long enoight?? I think this film is very overrated in my opinion... everyone has its own opinion so...
I love everything about this movie. The actors, the plot, and the cinematography.
This is the movie which is force me to sit continuously till the completion.

Its just nice watch it you wont regret it. Loved every part of this movie
This movie make me happy. I like the performances, the story and the references of the characters.
I love it, it is well written and produced , not to mention directing, i haven't really been reviewing movies, tv shows etc but i had to start with "The GodFather" they should keep making more like this.
Simply put, a masterpiece. Every actor is at their best, the story is incredible, and the direction from Coppola is masterful. Everyone must watch this film once in their life..
I think it is a very good movie, it is a very good creation with first-rate actors, it is very good to enjoy one weekend.
What can you say about this? This is close to a "perfect movie" The direction was perfect. The casting, the script, the drama, the editing all Superb.

Watching Al Pacino as Micheal literally changing his "personna" throughout the course of this story is awesome.

And of course this was "Brando's" finest hour. Also the score and editing were perfect.

The effects were done masterfully. James Cann's portrayal of the "Hot Tempered" Sonny was stunning.

An absolute MUST for every movie collection!
One of the top movies... i recommend to watch it.....think deeper, see deeper, seek deeper levels of the movie
By far one of if not the best cinematic pieces ever created.

50 years old this year, and still stands the test of time.

If you are a Godfather fan, you must watch the 10 episodes produced by Paramount called "The Offer."

Great movie will forever be a classic. alot of violence so make sure the kids arent around unless you want to ruin there little brains over all great movie enjoyed my time watching had me screaming the whole time
I still don´t get how it took so long to have this movie on DVD, specially considering all the crap it´s been "burned" nowadays. Anything anyone could say about this movie will be hopelessly short. And I wonder why? I mean, how come a mob family novel became an obliged reference of movie making? It´s not certainly the only mob movie neither mob movie masterpiece. But, there is the fine balance between poetry and crime, honor and reckless vengeance. There are the unforgettable lines at the precise time that make this film so believable, so close to everyone that makes you fall in love with Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. There is pain, love, crime, vengeance and the greatest solitude of the powerful man that has to lie to his beloved wife.

If you have not seen this all time masterpiece, don´t wait any longer to HAVE IT you will never get tired of it!

This film is by far the best film that I have ever seen. With a cast strewn with some of the best actors in the industry and arguable some of the best ever, delivering such intense performances, they could have won an Oscar for Ishtar. However, they are connected to a brilliant story, script and cinematography, making for a virtually flawless story.
I loved this movie and to this day this movie still has recognition.
perfect, real perfect. when i watch this film, i fell it whole my body. and Al Pacino acts unimaginable. thank you Coppola. All the people that like watching movies all over the world, know THE GODFATHER. and nearly all of them say that it is the best film i have ever seen. Marlon Brando acts one of the best acts of movie history. for me Al Pacino acts the best of best all times. Mario Puzo wrote the best story and Francis Ford Coppola directed great. so it is the best really best. Everybody want to watch films near real life. The Godfather is real. you can feel it. i wish all the film like just The Godfather. Thanks all.
This film has all the elements it takes to make an excellent movie. Based on Mario Puzo's novel, it provides an insight on an Italian mob family in New York: The Corleones. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give incredible performances as Michael Corleone and Don Vito Corleone. Keeping you at the edge of your seat throughout, it's probably the best movie I've ever seen.
The best movie in the history.i love godfather part1 and great marlon brando. H's godfather movie

Overall the acting for everyone in this movie were really good tbh. would recomend this movie if yall havent watched it
In this lockdown. this is the first movie i watched. a Must watch movie for all those who like something exciting. the power, Mind and Decision of Godfather. Mind blowing movie.
Anybody who denies the entire trilogy as being a cinematic masterpiece is not a fan of cinema. This is by far and will most likely be the best picutre of all time. It is a movie that contains some of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures. Marlon Brando had a stunning comeback as the result of this movie. Al Pacino also proved that he is truly one of the screens greatest actors and this movie reminds us why we love him so much. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Richard Constellano vividly brought their characters to life in a truly unforgettable film in the first film while Robert De Niro and Lee Strassberg did it in the second film. All in all this is the greatest trilogy of all time


Everytime my favourite film. I watched 2k times. The godfather is arguably the best drama ever. What stands out most in the movie is Italy's old town architecture and shooting techniques.old but gold.

The violence is over all, a bit less agressive in this film, and there is definitely much less sex. The language is a bit more harsh, but language happens, and there is probably more language at your middle school or high school than, in this movie. Other than one scene, any teen could watch it. When (don't want to give spoilers) a guy is talking to an old man. he sticks a knife into the guy's belly and moves it up to his neck. It shows tonnes of blood pouring out of his belly and the man leaves the knife in the man's neck. This is why this movie is not for children and definitely deserves a hard r rating.
This is a very good movie I really liked it and I love the storyline of this mlvie
What can I say that hasn't already been said? This movie is amazing - from its gorgeous cinematography to its wonderfully crafted characters, this movie is nothing but a masterpiece from the start. You can literally dissect any scene from this film - its that brilliant. Its a masterpiece of cinema that everyone - yes, EVERYONE - should someday experience. Easily 10/10, no question whatsoever.


One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
Truly an amazing film up there as one of my favorite films of all time if you like these types of movies watch it now if you haven't seen a movie like this watch it now you will love it.
Cant say anything. Phenomenal performanes. One of the best soundtracks ever. Directing is unbelievable. Characterization is extraordinary....

One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
This is great man, an new idol when first I have seen. Strong, Cool and Inteligent
Okay,I've got to say,this is the best movie of all time.It's got story,great acting,and memorable scenes.First of all,the movie is about Michael Corleone's transformation from an innocent to a mafia don.And I grew up with MTV,so I'm not just high,okay? Besides,Michael learned the ropes because of his father,who was in the mafia,idiots.And for the user who said that this is typical American trash,I've got to say:.In fact,you're lucky we have movies that don't revolve around tea drinking crumpet eating idiots who just sit around the whole time talking about their day at the country club.And besides,British actors SUCK!But back to the point,the Godfather is THE best movie of all time,and if you don't agree,then IDC,you're an idiot,or a pot smoker.Thanks for reading!And if you have any intellectual response to this,please post.
Recently saw this movie, liked it. A bit long but keeps you involved throughout. Al and Marlon are phenomenal. To me the best part of the series.


This is an amazing movie that you can watch in any year and no matter how old this movie gets you are always going to love it.

I enjoyed every second in this film it was so amazing and i can't belive that this film was filmed at 1972 absolutely wow the story was amazing of Careyoli family and all the story about mafias
Godfather is one of the best Mafia movies ever. I've watched it over 50 times and still get excited when I watch it now .
The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individua.
Why people see it as one of the greatest movies can be for different tastes
I enjoyed watching this dope film while in middle school and thought everything about the movie was very good
This is really one of the best movies I've ever seen!

Actors are amazing, the story is great, Sicilian accent is also really good! The photography, the lights, the sceneries, the costumes, all really looks very well studied.
AMAZING FILM, CLASSIC AND RETRO, ITS A MASTERPIECE AND I GOT STUCK IN THIS MOVIA SO HARD
The acting sone in this movie is simply amazing! I am spellbound. What could be more appealing to people than watching such talented actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and lot more. This is like a complete package!
Loved it.



the best movie ever made in the world
This is my second best movie which I have ever watched. Thanks a lot director for this amazing story.
Acting 10/10 Plot 10/10 Cinematography 10/10 Overall 10/10

Godfather films are considered to be the greatest movies ever made, which a lot of film directors even used it as their reference in making films related to mobs and mafia. Truly this movie and its successors are recommended to watch.
An underground family represented as a "necessary evil" address the requests of local members who are unsatisfied with law enforcement results. Here you will find a man that runs an empire, hoping his family will continue his legacy of justice.
The first time the first part of the movie was a different feeling of watching such movie with such great concept and actors at to the point with so reality in each and every character, the story lines, the overall climax of the scene was like it's should be a never ending story such was the vision of the story. I wish we could have more parts in the 20s as well...!!!
After watching this movie I lived for the same for some days 😁 what a story what a act, amazing mafia kind goosebumps.
One of the classic iconic movies of all times. Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors !
World best movie..nothing to say specchless story ....just say its the best and no movie beat that movie still now in 2021.

This was amazing! I watched this with my Kids and we loved it.
Simply flawless,that's all there is to it.It's hard for me to talk about this film as I have nothing but good things to say about as it's my favorite film of all time.The whole cast is awesome,led by Brando's legendary performance as Don Vito Corleone,quite possibly my favorite performance ever.And Al Pacino became a star here as Michael,who goes from straight laced college man to cold-hearted mafioso.James Caan,Robert Duvall,John Cazale...I could go on and on.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is excellent,there's an amazing score by Nino Rota,the period detail is spot on.I love this movie to death.My number one film of all time.
I don't really know what to add to the reviews of this film to make my review worth reading. The Godfather is a so well done, masterfully crafted film that deserves to be the Top 1 film in IMDB. Well it's not that far since it's ranking n. 2 as of now. I am a film lover and I have watched some amazing movies, many good ones, but also too many that disappointed me. I can honestly say that The Godfather is far beyond being amazing. The Godfather stands out in many ways: acting, cinematography, directing, soundtrack, story and of course production design, which is flawless. I've watched it 3 times and I know that, soon enough, I will watch it again.
Ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd dddddddddddddddd dddddddddddddd dddddddddddddd dddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddddd dddddddddddddd dddddddddddddd dddddddddddd
MASTERPIECE. BEST MOVIE EVER. IM RATED 10 FOR TOP 1.
Every time George Hamilton appears onscreen, we can't help but miss the great Robert Duvall, and though Coppola has slightly trimmed his daughter Sofia's screen time, it's still an unfortunately amateurish performance, especially when contrasted with the go-big-or-go-home method of Andy Garcia as her volatile cousin and love interest. But Pacino and Diane Keaton as Kay, his ex-wife (and the love of his life) and the mother of his children, are magnificent together in some of the movie's quietest and most effective moments. And there's something great and offbeat about Joe Mantegna's performance as the violent mob boss Joey Zasa; Mantegna performs his lines as if he's onstage doing a play by his longtime collaborator David Mamet, e.g., when Mantegna as Zasa says in staccato fashion, "Yes, it's true, if anyone could say such a thing, he would not be a friend, he would be a dog."
When everything comes together! And lasts you get this.
Love this crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
I love this movie and all of the GF movies. This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay.
This movie is a classic... You can watch it twenty times and still find it awesome. A young Al Pacino doing a great performance, the unforgettable Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, and my favorite character, Tom Hagen, beautifully played by Robert Duvall. The Godfather is a long film that doesn't get people tired... something pretty uncommon. The violence is very well portrayed in the assassinations scenes, I don't want to write any spoiler, so you will have to watch the movie to understand me... Also the music is extraordinary, musicians like Nino Rota are very hard to find. For those reasons and for lots of others, I totally recommend watching The Godfather... and also The Godfather II & III (I think they're not as great at the first part, but are really worth-watching).


"The Godfather" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.

The perfect movie. Every role is played well. The story is awesome.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

A masterpiece, everyone should watch. Al Pacino reinvented himself.




This movie is great example of motivation. It will be the 1st best movie in my list.
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.
Best movie I've ever seen this is a cult better than all movies.
This film has become an instant classic and my second favourite film surpassed only by its sequel which is a rare portrait of an American masterpiece and fine art. The cast of Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Cazale, Keaton, Shire, Castellano, Conte, Marley, and Martino are unsurpassed.
This movie deserves its place on the top of IMDb's top 250 list. The acting is excellent nobody did bad in this film even the extras. The cinematography was beautiful showing New York in the World War Two era with great authenticity. If you have not seen this excellent movie then you should rent a copy and if you enjoy it buy the box set and watch the entire collection. I believe even the third movie was a masterpiece most people did not like that one because the movie was a little fast paced without any relaxed and beautiful moments like the first two. I believe that everybody should see this movie and even if it doesn't show the Mafia realistically it is still an American Masterpiece and should be watched by everyone.
I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people.

I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
Short, Sweet, and..."to the point". This film digs in, exposes, in a languid and gorgeous tone. What is the root of all evil, at least here in America? The Godfather, well, he might know.
Did not care for The Godfather. Didn't like it! Everyone always says "It's so good. It's like the perfect movie." Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, all fine, fine actors, did not like the movie. Why? I couldn't get into it. It insists upon itself. It takes forever getting in, you spend like six and a half hours, I can't even get through it. I can't even finish the movie. I've never even seen the ending. I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs. I have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they're speaking a different language. That's where I lose interest and I go away. I love The Money Pit with the guy from Big. Funny guy, Tom Hanks, everything he says is a stitch!
Just that i dont need to say anything more its very good of a movie changed my life and put my standars to high now i cant look at any other movie with the same eyes and the same mind.

A real masterpiece of a movie that every one should experience once in their life.
COOL.

COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL.

One of the best Gangster movies ever made. This is the movie that has inspired several film makers across the world. Though many gangster movies have been produced, nothing comes closer to the GODFATHER.
This is the finest example of film making-EVER! There isn't another film which could better this cast. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Cann, Turner etc. Although Method acting is not my favourite style, it is used to it's strengths here.

Name a better actor than Brando over the last fifty odd years in film and stage? Not possible, Pacino and co come close but not close enough. This gave rise to so many other gangster creations. Goodfellas, The Sopranos, Casino to name a few. How Al never got an oscar for his Michael Corleone is a crime in itself.

If you haven't seen the film then you have to or else you haven't lived. Everything is perfect, acting, scenery, lighting, music, direction, you will be hard pushed to find a film that matches any one of those.

This is the greatest film of all time. It was Coppola's best, Brando's and Pacino's best. What more could you need? 11/10
Fantastic!!!! All the three one are great!!! This one has Marlon Brando, Pacino, Durvall, Diane Keaton!!! Need more?!!? well, a great history, great pictures, and a great director!!!! All the actors are great and show a lot of reality in theirs act!!! PAcino drives trough the good guy to the Godfather, shows the world the greatest actor we'd see along with Deniro!!! Brando is a perfect Italian Godfather!!! He Shows a lot of respect for the caracheter, and inspare you fear and passion. Just see the scene of him, wuth Bosanera!!!!! What a Act, What a Show. The calm and smooth talk, he gives, and then the aggression he talks to Johnny Fontaine!!!!!!! IN FACT, along with Godfather part II THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!!!!

Simply put, the standard by which all other films are measured. Two of the greatest acting performance of all time by Pacino and Brando create two of the most memorable film characters of all-time, the gentlemanly don Vito Corleane and his reluctant son/heir Micheal. Full of great moments (the horse head in the movie producer's bed, the chilling baptism scene) and great lines this is Coppolla greatest film by far. The score and cinematography only add to this film's mastery. A terrific film, one that anyone who calls himself a movie fan should see at least once, and probably many many times!

, I haven't bothered to review "The Godfather". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing.

There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head.

My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit.
This film is just mind blowing! I love it! The characters, the music and the story - I had goosebumps all the time. The film is perfect. Its great directing meeting great great artists.
This movie has everything, beautiful acting, strong directing, mind blowing script. I'll never forget this movie for many reasons, 3 already stated above and also the last reason is because its portrayal of mafia underworld couldn't be any nearer to the truth. I'll never get tired of watching it. The casting is perfect as no other actor could probably portray these characters better. This is due to the number of auditions and the right choice made by Francis Ford Coppola. The music is so perfect for this movie that it just draws you in.

I still think Al Pacino deserved an Oscar for this because he obviously has done his homework here.
This is the greatest film ever to be made. I haven't seen a film that I could even compare to this film. It made me smile, it made me thrilled, it made me shed a tear and it made me think. The Godfather is a movie about families. I do not believe Hollywood will ever come out with a movie of this caliber again.

Your's Truly, Gavin Hall
I don't know why this is rated so highly. It is dated and I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing happens for a very long time and when it does, it is ok, but this "great" film represents three hours of my life I will never get back. Better watching "The Sopranos."
The God Father one fo the greatest American Story lines of all time. This hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. The entire series is must watch for those who have never watched it, or need to watch it again..
It has been observed that the women's roles are negligible in this movie: Kay is naïve, and Michael's wife in Sicily is little more than eye candy. The other wives are not active players in the movie either. But to say that this is not about something is to misjudge the film.

This is the most interesting film I have seen so far. It contains a lot of life principles. I like it very much. Every month I will look at it again. Each time it can bring me a different experience. I really won't get tired of it at all. Too many details and scenes are handled very well, which makes people can't help praising,
This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time. An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
i will make this short BEST FILM EVER!! best actors best sets best story line best everything there's no bad points but i think the 2nd godfather film is the best one but this is still very very very good some of the best sense in the movie (1) sunny gets shot a lot (2) the godfather Vito gets shot (3) Michael shots the two guys (4) Michael becomes the godfather (5) Michael goes away and lives in Italy i have never read the book but i played the game and watched all 3 movies its just pure greatness if you think its not then i am sorry your not right in the head i sure lots of people think its the best i do! i would like to see someone try to top the godfather by making a 4 one you would be crazy to try and do it

Quite an entertaining film that I recommend to friends. An entertaining plot will not leave anyone indifferent, a story that makes you think. I definitely advise everyone to watch this sudo cinema.


The Godfather is a classic of cinema, no one can dispute this, and the fact that he became an example for all directors for many years. As well as an example of quality cinema and set a high bar for everyone.


Best Recommended for everyone interested in action movies.

Absolutely a must watch movie of all time. Don Vito Corleone, head of a mafia family, decides to hand over his empire to his youngest son Michael. However, his decision unintentionally puts the lives of his loved ones in grave danger.
Wow this movie was really that great, i hope for who doesnt watch this film you must watch this movie. The cast, character all was great. Many good scenes you can see from this movie. Al pacino, robert de niro there acting was really awesome until now i havent seen bad reviews from this movie.

It was a great movie. I can watch it again every 2 years. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

The Godfather is one of my favorites. Action real life events you can't beat it. This movie is one of a kind.when I first seen it I thought it was going to be like every other movie dealing with gangs. But The Godfather taught me lessons I didn't know I could learn from just watching it.

Worst film I don't know why the hell this movie got Oscar
A wellcrafted movie this year. This is my first review and they are setting the bar straight at the back of those people who just finished the movie. The God Father is phenomenal and will expose a lot of things on the other side of the road and that I believe is one of the key components why it has created buzz all across the intenet.

A seasoned movie that nobody can resist.

Tied for the best movie I have ever seen.

Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.
One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.

The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.
If there is a film that should be rated with a 10 In the history of film making its this one Flawless Based on a great book Amazing direction All star cast with amazing performances One of the best soundtracks in history.

"The Godfather" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.
It was the most boring film I've ever forced myself to endure in my entire life! I tried to tell myself it was good to be a part of the hype surrounding it but I just couldn't justify ever telling another soul to watch this movie. The boringness combined with characters that, I for one could not tell the difference between, being so unremarkable led for the biggest snooze fest of a film viewing ever! I don't understand the hype and personally it annoys me that this takes the #2 spot away from other incredible films!

This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.

This Film Has Great Plot Great Dialogues,Great Acting,Beautiful Score And Cinematography. What Do You Want More? People Can attach Themselves With The Characters of This Film.
This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
The movie is really great and one of the best movies I've ever seen for me. Great acting ,great direction , great cinematography and great plot. I really enjoyed it .

This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed.
This movie is a pioneer to so many that have come after it. It paved the way like few have done before.

Definitely a slow burn, but that's partly what makes it so good. The build up, several scenes are thrilling, leaving your heart pounding, needing to know what's going to happen and how it's going to play out. It doesn't rely on constant, needless, high-speed action. Something almost impossible to do for a 3 hour runtime. Instead, the slow progression of a character's transformation. It's a beautiful thing that few get right, but The Godfather absolutely nails it.

Everything simply just "works", from the story, casting, themes, cinematography, music, etc. So many aspects come together to make one extraordinary, poetic film. That's how and why this film still holds up after nearly 50 years.
Terrible... Just terrible. Nauseatingly dull and exceedingly over-hyped. Honestly I could never even think to sit through any of Diane Keaton's acting in my life it is so horrid. Possibly the worst acting that I have ever even witnessed! (Let me tell you I mean that about every single person that is in this film).

I wouldn't even consider writing any more review for such a scathing, vile film of nothingness. Evil movie, don't open this. Do not watch this. Do not speak its words. If I could take back any of the time that I spent watching this movie then I would, because I feel as if a piece of my hollow soul has been torn from my within, and that it is not something that I could ever have back.
The name is perfectly fit for this movie. This is the GODFATHER of all other movies. If you are looking for a movie that should forget you about time, this is it.

A perfect movie. Everything is well written and acting is on point. Even after so many years, it's still one of the best movies ever created and it will stay like that for a long time!

I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
One of the greatest films of all time, a true masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama, as well as the film that established the standard.

In the story, the Mafia is seen from within. That is its secret, allure, and spell; it has shaped how the general public perceives the Mafia ever since. In place of the real world, there is an authoritarian patriarchy ruled by the Godfather, with betrayers as the only bad guys. Michael (Al Pacino) gave the following advice: "Never take sides against the family." The Godfather traces the arc of this doomed idealism with a beauty that is still fresh.
There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. I love and watch every month at least once.

Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.....


I have always loved mafia movies like Goodfellas but The Godfather trilogy is just so much better.

Marlon Brando is just amazing and the other actors (especially Al Pacino and James Caan) are also really good. The film is very long but it didn't bother me and it certainly isn't boring like some people have said. Much of the length is caused because Coppola put great care into making his characters seem "real". And concentrating on the family rather than the crime business, Coppola and Puzo put an amazing depth into the characters.

Simply put: The best mafia movie ever.



One of the best movies of all time has in it's cast some of the best actors of all time , some of them already had been nominated or won the academy award and the others won it after their performance in this masterpiece. Let's not forget Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzzo who had a big role in this movie's success beside the actors performance. The movie shows almost every aspect of life switching from emotion to tragedy in a unique way , as the same with the characters witch is Michaels case , changing from a loving young man and uninterested of power to a man that is unflinching in his belief. That in one word : Breathtaking



The Godfather was one of the first "classic" films I ever watched, and even after viewing other highly regarded films (On the Waterfront, Raging Bull, Citizen Kane, Gone With the Wind, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, The Third Man) it remains my favorite. Although it may not be the greatest film of all time (that honor goes to Citizen Kane), there will always be a special place in my heart for The Godfather. The seamlessness of the story and the richness of the distinct characters make it such an enjoyable film to watch that I am in awe every time I view it. I have watched it in whole or in parts dozens of times, and it is simply one film that I will never tire of.


Longest movie I've ever slept through. It's boring and not entertaining. The only realistic thing about this movie is that the mafia spends most of its time sitting, eating and talking. 'The irishman' was long too but it was entertaining and didn't make me want to put a hit out on myself after watching it.

Al Pacino,James Caan,Marlon Brando,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton...just perfect.Not only that it has the greatest actors ever,its story is perfect too.

Before the movie was even made one of the greatest actors auditioned for the casts.Did you know that Elvis wanted to play Michael Corleone? Even the music is perfect for the movie.Larry Kusic and Nino Rota composed the music for the movie.You need to have The love theme.Really Great.

Through the years Godfather got famous and even more.Everybody knows the movie,the actors,even the game which got released in 2006 (don't got it but maybe someday).

I recommend this movie to everybody who is into Crime,Drama,...and everybody who loves the acting of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.
I don't think this movie deserves 9.2. It is a boring family drama movie, no doubt the actors were one of the best but overall the movie is super bore and normal crime/drama movie. But again I'll say the cast was superb. Just see shawshank redemption, it's a masterpiece and godfather just doesn't deserve to be so close to shawshank
The Godfather is a true definition of great filmaking. Unbelieveable acting by Marlon Brando, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, and of course Al Pacino. The story itself is unlike any other I have ever seen. Landmark! Simply Landmark! It really invented a new genre of Mafia films. Often copyed never duplicated, except its sequel The Godfather Part II.
Today a very well known movie and for me the best ever. The story is based on the novel -The Godfather- from which the movie obviously got its name and it follows the most part of the story in the novel. The cast is also excellent the stars who play each character fit their role in the movie perfectly. Some parts of the story may become confusing to some audience if they don't pay much attention to the movie, i found the movie more interesting when i watched it the 3rd time because I had missed some tiny details which make this movie so good. The story won't become boring, it keeps you watching the movie all the time because you really want to know what will happen next which is quite rare in many movies. The effects are also done well for the 70's period, they look very realistic. The movie really gives you a good description of that dark period in history in a non boring way.Those who enjoy watching drama will love this movie.
Plot Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally pursued when he refuses to Sully the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour

The Godfather packs more into one gangster film than some genres output over decades. It is a big film with big themes, has memorable characters and lines. Mario Puzo novel once again proves that he's the master of storytelling — and Francis Ford Coppola of thrillingly violent filmmaking. With its all star cast this should go straight to the head of the list of essential viewing. With a classic sequel also to view. You will rarely get it so good.

Makes Bernard Mungeam 5 star films
An American classic, and one of the greatest film's ever made. Director Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The film chronicles a ten year span (1945 to 1955) in the life of the Italian-American Corleone crime family of New York City.

It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. The greatest gangster film ever made. Coppola offers a rich and layered look at family and does so with an incredible cast and a meticulous amount of detail

"must see" masterpiece.
Perhaps the greatest film of all time. Atleast in it's genre. This is the film that started the career of Al Pacino and made a legend of Marlon Brando. Director, Francis Ford Copolla shows how stunningly beautiful violence can be in film. Also how we the viewer can see a little bit of ourselves in the twisted underground realm where passion and tragedy go hand in hand.
Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.

The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia.

There is no doubt that The Godfather is one of the cinematic experiences of all time. The Godfather is perfect, and there is no denying that. A story which excites and threats, acting which is convincing on every level and shot in a unique style- so why not 10? For me a 10 movie has to be perfect and mean something to me- this film is perfect but with the wealth of characters and its popularity takes away that special edge. To make a perfect film is an achievement, to make a perfect film with another touch is near impossible. I've only ever once offered a film 10/10 and The Godfather won't be my second. That said, still a brilliant piece of work. 9/10.

when I watched this move I thought it was boring but when the story unraveled it was one of my favorite movies.it is most certainly a perfect film If you have not seen it you almost have to. have to just for reference it comes on peach tree all the time. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right.
A ten by far. One of the greatest pieces of film ever to be created. Nothing can compare to it's magnitude. Perfect. Brando's greatest performance along with Pacino and Coppola. Like it's title it is the "Godfather" of all films. A template for all films to follow.
This movie is beyond words. It is motion picture history. I remember the first time i saw it. I was captivated by it's magical realism. I was swept away. What i saw was poetry in motion. At that moment i knew there will never be a movie as perfect as this. All movies should be compared to this. Artistically, technically and emotionally it is simply untouchable.
There is very little more that can be said about this wonderful film. It sits proudly at the top of the IMDB top 250 and to be honest for anything else to knock it off, especially the grossly overrated 'Shawshank Redemption' would be a travesty.

The thing that sticks out most for me in this movie and its equally superb follow up is the quality of acting on show from everyone. Brando and Pacino obviously stand out but even the most incidental characters seem real and alive. The building tension in the Slazzo/McLusckey restaurant scene is special. Full marks all round for a wonderful piece of cinema.
the godfather is by far the best movie i have ever seen along with the godfather part 2 the first time i saw the godfather i was nothing but speechless it was so good i thought i was dreaming i couldn't believe how perfect the movie was it was so perfect i had to watch it a second time just to make sure i wasn't dreaming and its true i wasn't dreaming i am telling you the godfather is the best movie ever made if you do not own this movie or have never seen it i highly recommend that you do you from the way everything happens to the way the story paces it is a masterpiece in every way i just can not say enough about it heck i liked it so much i sold one of my favorite games just so i could have the money to buy the collection so i could see number 2&3 the godfather is a true cinematic masterpiece and nothing but a masterpiece
First i thought that The men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this..... VERY bad movie. I don't care how many people gave it a 10 (don't know why). I want to write my opinion. It is long, boring, a lot of talking, a lot families, names, doing "buissnes".... Did i mention that it is boring? The movie lacks a good storyline. It doesn't matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all. There is no comedy, there is very little action, drama (here and there somebody gets killed). I had better fun watching politicians than this.

I just wasted 6 hours of my life. (together with the second part)

Better watch Scarface, Casino or Reservoir Dogs. My other movies are Braveheart, Gladiator, Shawshank, Lethal weapon, Black hawk down....
Watched it as a kid, reviewed it later! Masterpiece!

This movie is one of the best movies i seen, great actors, we liked the bad people and this was the most negative part.

The quintessential movie of movies. No movie comes close to The Godfather. Inspiring performances from Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando and of course, Al Pacino. This movie is so real, so riveting that you feel for these mobsters, these supposed monsters of our civilization. In the scene where Pacino shoots the drug lord and the cop, you are screaming to yourself as Michael is waiting to do the deed, "shoot them, please, shoot them!" This piece of cinema greatness is Coppola's masterwork and arguably the best movie of all time.
A perfect movie. Perfectly cast, beautifully shot, great acting from everyone involved, the development of each character is fascinating to watch and just watching Al Pacino and Brando give a masterclass in acting is delightful.

The Godfather. You just say that name and most people get a picture of Vito or Michael in their head. They can literally see the shady suits and the corrupt deals. This movie defined a generation, people who were kids when it came out wear the badge with honor. I, for one, was not blessed with that gift, but I did grow up with this movie. I convinced my parents to get this movie for me when I was about 12-years old. I sat down and watched it so intently, that for years if someone talked about a scene and didn't say the words just right, I could correct them and tell them down to about the minute where to find that scene in the movie. I would go to Jr. High and talk like I was Vito Corleone, and I'd recruit friends to be in my family. We became a tight bunch because of that fact, so basically, what I'm saying is, The Godfather is responsible for a lot of joy in my life. One of the top 10 greatest movies of all time.


For many years "Lawrence of Arabia" was my favorite movie. And, as a serious student of cinema I very much admire "Citizen Kane." But, at some point during the 1970's "The Godfather" overtook all others, and I doubt seriously whether we will see the likes of this magnificent film again in my lifetime.

In "The Godfather" all the elements of picture-making come together in splendid perfection. The script, actors, cinematography, production values, music, effects, and direction are all superb and seamless. Sex, violence, loyalty, betrayal, revenge, love, hate, and even comedy--all find a home here. It is a remarkable achievement, equaled only by "The Godfather--Part II."
I have seen this movie over 20 times now and i can say for sure this picture should never be touched and is what they should teach in college and universities for Art major and any one should at least see it one time ,it teaches you life experiences from 40 years ago that still applies to modern lifestyles.
As close to a perfect film as you're going to get. The young, fairly new director(in 1972)Francis Ford Coppola did an outstanding job of getting A+ performances out of his 'entire' cast. When watching this masterpiece of American film, one does not even take notice that they are watching actors perform. Instead, it's as if a hidden camera has captured the real lives of a post war New York mafia family. This is by far my favorite film of all time and recomend it as a must see. I envy the person who will have the thrill of seeing it for the first time. It's quite awsome.

Film ini sangat spesial, 1 of the best film in my life and im very lucky watching this film after the Shawshank redemption
The Godfather is the best movie ever made. I recommend it to everybody who hasn't seen it, you don't know what your are missing. Its perfection that's why gave it a 10 in rating. Every time I see the movie again it amazes me how good it is.
one of the greatest dramas ever made, it's the nerve in the movie, that feeling. i just can't put my finger in it, i guess it's francis ford coppolas extraordinary sense for making excellent movies. one other thing is that both the second and third part are worthy followers, a hard thing to manage
This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers.
The acting of Marlon Brando overlaped the acting of Al-Pachino. The acting of each character was up to the mark. The story-line was very stretegic and much more facinating comparing to the book.
WOW........This movie is amazing. Francis Ford Cappola really did an amazing job with this movie.He is a genius.I also give credit to Mario Puzo for writing the book.I absolutely love this movie. All three of them are really amazing.Marlon Brando did one of the most amazing performances of his career and in movie history and the infamous DON VITO CORLEONE.Nobody can do such an amazing job as Mrlon Bando.He made the movie.For all the people who haven't seen The Godfather IT'S A MUST SEE!!!!!!.The first time i saw The Godfather I was speechless. All of the performances were outstanding.They will blow your mind.Im not saying that its the ONLy greatest mob movie.There's other classics such as GOODFELLAS,THE UNTOUCHABLES,and many many more.Once again if you have not seen The Godfather WATCH IT please.
This entire series being a classic, I had to watch it. I regret all of it. It was 12-13 hours of my life that I won't get back.

This movie is horrible. The plot moves slowly, drearily, and almost nothing happens. Audio is shabby, and understanding what is going on, and most crucially: WHY? is incredibly difficult. Keeping track of who is what guy is also difficult, as the names are rarely said; the lighting is poor, making this even worse. I didn't know who was who until the third movie, which I had to force myself to watch.

As a classic, watch it. Doesn't mean you have to like it, but now you can say why you hated it, which is the best part for me.
As far as I'm concerned, there is no other movie that could compete with The Godfather. Having seen it for more than a couple of times, I still find it great. I have read the book for a couple of times and I will read it again after the exams, when I have more time, because it's even better than the movie. I strongly recommend reading the book and watching the movie.
This movie may have comes out 25 years before i was born, but recently my mom came home with the 40th anniversary edition. I just finished watching the first and second film, they are amazing i just can't stop talking about them. I love the power games there is between everyone. Im not much for gangster or action films, but this really got to me. It was amazing to watch it on blue ray the light was perfect. I enjoyed every little part of this film, and didn't seem to noticed it lasted almost 3 hours. I don't ever write reviews but this was a film i think everyone should watch, its a timeless masterpiece which I'm sure would could be enjoyed by many in my generation. And the acting is superb, but Al never seems to disappoint me.
The Godfather is simply a truly great film, that has some of the best acting ever committed to film. Pacino is superb, Brando inspiring and Caan one of cinemas great angry men. It is a film of operatic brilliance and I is the best gangster film ever made.
I truly loved The Godfather and I'm 14. The movie is absolutely hard to dislike, ex. great acting, great dialogue, great way of ending the film. I can't believe this film got only 3 Academy Awards. It deserved a lot better than that. James Caan should have won Best Supporting Actor. He was excellent as he was aggressive. Yes, this is the greatest film of all time, better than Citizen Kane, which was a very good movie as well. What I most loved about The Godfather is that it is completely original and unforgettable. If you don't like it, "I'll give you an offer you can't refuse." Ha, ha.
Once Upon A Time In America is a far superior movie. Francis Ford Coppola shoots his movies like asshole, but then again so do his pals Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. If Sergio Leone had directed this like he was originally asked to, it would have been great, but he didn't, he passed it by. Martin Scorcese also would have made a harder kick ass version and I don't mean more violent, I mean Just-Plain-Better. Instead you have the weak cinema of an overrated narcissist. Of course it's a decent film, but it's far from a timeless classic like the afore mentioned OUATIA. It's as dated a Dirty Harry, but you don't see that in the top ten films of all time. The greatest technical achievement made by the film makers was in the field of Special Make-up Effects, by Dick Smith. That is all.
One of the great American Classics. Expresses what family is all about. Well thought out and ambitious. Each scene is amazing and filled with drama.
You may be wondering what all the fuss is about. Allow me to explain. What we have here in The Godfather is a film that is flawless in mostly every area. A film so deeply ingrained in our pop-culture that we aware of it without a direct mention. It takes a rich, deep, and intimate narrative; mixes it with stunning performances from a brilliant cast; adds the startling and intense direction of Francis Ford Coppola, and finishes it all off with an array of imagery and dialogue that is imbued in every film lovers' mind.

It is immaculately paced, rewarding, and allows you to take something new from it every time you see it. This is everything a film should be. Go watch it.
Well where can I start it was just fantastic from start to finish. The mix of innocent Michael getting mixed up. I was just gripped by this. All the actors in this movie are top notch and especially with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in it. Also the likes of Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton who have made a real name for themselves a real name from this movie. I could not get enough of Michael Corleone, that icy character that hardly lost his temper, and never would let you know what he was thinking, really gripped into watching this movie over and over again.my hat comes off to Francis and his team they have made a true masterpiece that is THE GODFATHER. I really do reccomend this movie to anybody who knows good film.
Well where can I start it was just fantastic from start to finish. The mix of innocent Michael getting mixed up, to becoming the most street-wise mob boss of all time. I was just gripped by this.

The Godfather was the first movie I ever saw that Al Pacino was in. I was glued to the TV the first time I saw it (of course I was, who wouldn't be?). Now Al Pacino is my favorite actor. The Godfather is one of my favorite movies of all time!! Not only that, it is one of the greatest movies of all time!!!!!
There is little to add to the comments on this message board and numerous other sources- The Godfather is simply the best movie released. Not "Best Gangster Movie", not "Best Mafia Movie"- there are no qualifiers needed. The movie captures so many elements of great cinema- story, casting, writing, direction, production qualities, that it rises above every other movie released. See this movie and marvel at the transformation of Michael Corleone, the intensity of Sonny, the ineptness of Fredo, the emptiness of Connie and how Tom Hagen calculates every move, always looking for the acceptance from the rest of the family. Vito Corleone is a study of cunning abilities. The family looks to him for guidance and advice, even while the world is moving so quickly to overtake them.
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
I'm too considering as this movie has to be praised. I watched it when I was only 8. And now I am 31, and really I enjoyed even I watched it many times. Thanks for the director Mr. Coppola, producers, actors & actresses who played in and executed it. This movie was the best I've ever watched in my all life. Thank you boyz & girlz.
coppolla's masterpiece stands alone in film history. From the festive begginning to the inevitable end, this movie truly moves one. In the tradition of the greek tragedy, the superb story is crafted on a man trying to evade his fate. Al pacino and Marlon Brando give the performances of their lives, and james Caan executes perfectly as the hotheaded sonny. Props to Coppolla's vision and ingenuity, truly one of the great films of all time.
I watched The Godfather back in 2012 .. but then I read the novel in 2017 and watched it again ...It is haunting and captivating tale of a mafia organization 9.5/10
The best movie i've ever seen . acting, music and directing . Everything is professionally in this movie i love it

I recently watched the 1968 French film "The Two of Us" directed by Claude Berri, which tells of the development of a relationship between an anti-Semetic old man in the country who becomes the guardian of a young Jewish boy during World War II. (Actually, the title of the French movie translates better to "The Old Man and the Boy".) To me, it appears that the scenes in "The Godfather" where Vito is an old man in a garden playing with a young boy with a spray can were very much informed by this French film. The film would certainly have been available to Coppola and Brando during the filming of "The Godfather". Although it may be stretching things a bit, the actor who portrays the old man in the French film has a very distinct chin, and it may be that Brando came up with the idea of putting tissues in his jowls from observing that actor. I wonder if others have spotted these similarities.
A true classic that never gets old. I regularly watch this (and both sequels) at least once a year, usually during either a snow day or a sick day.

There have been so many made over the years and there is the Godfather. What an amazing movie. The acting by all the actors(Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale & all the others)was just amazing. The level of detail the director went down to all the scenes was very very impressive and something that I'm yet to see in other movies. Both of the cinematography and the music score are perfect. We know nothing is perfect but this simply is just perfect. For example: The way the scene in the hospital was carried out was simply amazing. All the silence used in that scene really made things very tense for the viewers. From all the movies I've ever watched that scene has made me the most tense.

Watched this movie exactly 40 years after it's release, but loved watching every minute of it. Not every such movie keeps a watcher interested for the whole period of the show but this is different.


Not sure if I is better than I. Definitely a top ten movie. Seen it ____ and will continue seeing it again. One of the best mafia movies. Along with Scarface, Goodfellas, etc. Moe Greene Not sure if I is better than I. Definitely a top ten movie. Seen it ____ and will continue seeing it again. One of the best mafia movies. Along with Scarface, Goodfellas, etc.

I do not think i have ever seen such a magnificent piece of art in motion. Breathless, Composed and full of aloofness. GOD FATHER stands head and shoulder above the rest.The story is full of vivid imagination and given birth to a new genre of Crime/Gangster version. Which before GOD FATHER was a taboo subject and considered to be destined doom.

The characters have done full justice to the plot, playing out the roles with perfection. Credit must also be given to masterful directorship,

All an All GODFATHER remains the best piece of movie i have seen in my life and it has certainly inspired many moves of my life.

Fantastic!
Greatest movie for it's time. Make an offer I can't refuse.
There is nothing to say about this masterpiece man can only watch and let themselves get lost into it.
This movie is phenomenal. Coppola's masterpiece one of my favorite movie. Great casting, great writing, great directing. Coppola has made one of the best cult movies of all time. This movie aged well, his 34 years old but still has a strong cultural influence. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are insane. They acting is phenomenal. This movie has a really strong part. The Godfather is not just a mafia movie, it's not a move just for the mafia and crime movie fans, this movie is recommended for everyone. The movie has a great artistic approach and a great message. The movie is so memorable a lasts for a life.
A good action ,sort off history accuresy but one o the best performance from actors sad is the this day nobody make a good movie is just this movie make me smiley that exist .All old movie are the best.
I watched this movie, trying not to set my hopes too high, after everything i had heard about THE GODFATHER. I think its overrated. It's an OK story. But i do not think that this movie should be worshiped the way it is. I think most people say its the greatest movie of all times, Because someone said to those people that it was the greatest movie of all time. I on the other hand found it so boring. So completely overrated and just simply SO boring that i hope never to see the other episodes of this movie. I in fact pray my children in the future will never have to see such a bad movie. Im sorry to say these thing and sound like a hater. But i really just do not agree with you and other who find this movie so magnificent. But i found this movie very bad apart from ill make him an offer he cant refuse story. Other than that i found this movie a mistake.


.....for true cinema fans. I feel more like I'm just casting my vote to help keep this from being caught by "Shawshank Redemtion", which not only isn't even close to being the 2nd best film of all time (I was thinking more like "Casablanca, "Sunset Blvd.", "Gone With the Wind", etc...), but isn't close to being the best film of the 90's (Pulp Fiction, Schindler List)). the Godfather is the best film of the 1970's, which was itself a peak time for film creativity. the performances here are truly a shining example of the best in naturalistic acting. the cinematography is unsurpassed, with the dark lighting playing a key role. a lot of women mistake this for a "guy movie" or "male fantasy". maybe it is, but it isn't ONLY that. the choice we all face between our dual nature is fascinating and compelling.



This film makes me love this generation all details all things makes this film iconic
This film is very Good everbody see this film the Good father
One of the best movies of the century! Tremendous acting by the cast, the story-line is well constructed! Although, the pace of the movie can be a bit slow for young audience but overall its wonderful! All in all, one of the few movies that contains everything, action, drama, suspense, thriller, romance and full of amazing dialogues and scenes! A must watch for everyone!
What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said before? Simply the Godfather, a movie that everyone should see sometime in their lives. I am young and I love it, highly recommended.
This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.

This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.
If you're a filmmaker this is a must watch film, break it down to its smallest detail. cinematography and lighting is one of the best i've seen in any film, very inspiring! I would watch it over and over and over. do not be afraid to underexpose. great directing character, everything about this film is grate. production design is on point and so does all the other elements of the craft. after watching this film from a director of photography point of view you develop more ideas and become very passionate about the way you handle your shadows, it's unbelievable how they achieved this kind of accuracy of exposure latitude with the tools they had back then back in the film era. Inspired and motivated to go experiment with lighting on my own of this practical style. masterpiece.

Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.

The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia.
The Godfather movies always special for me im maybe watched this movie 50 times but whenever i watched this movie its like first time im seeing this movie so this masterpiece is had not enough the words say to about you must watch and felling this movie
The best movie ever made in this genre. Among these three, the first part of the film was better than all of them. The brilliant performance of Brando and Pacino was one of the best.

Undoubtedly, it's a recurring masterpiece There was no trilogy that each of them was great But The godfather was, of course, an unrepeatable Trilogy

In some where while watching you will understand or may like the gang work
Godfather, more like, Cringefather. It is a film that is good, but cannot compare to the horror masterpiece that is Foodfight.

The fact this movie is consistently called the best movie of all time absolutely baffles me. This isn't even remotely one of my favorite movies, in fact its one of the worst I've seen. Its 3 hours long, which is far too long, it's beyond boring and the story, or what little story there is makes no sense. I did not understand why anything happened throughout the whole movie, each death just happened for seemingly no reason out of the blue. Some of the actors mumble so much they are impossible to understand or speak in Italian without subtitles, which doesn't help in following along with what's happening. This movie does not deserve the extreme high praise it has received, not by a long shot. Its single redeeming factor to me is the excellent cinematography for its time, I'll give it that.
This is the most Original movies ever made! Nothing can beat it. Good actors. Good set up. Everything is GREAT! If you want to spend your time. Watch it! If you want to spend your money. buy it! You cant get better then this. All mafia movies don't get closer to this one. So don't think that other mafia movies are better. Al Pacino. he takes to whole movie over. It cant be better with him. This movie gets a lot of awards, and of it is old. For me it can have more awards then it already haves. This movie don't need any special effect. For its old fashion look it haves more character. Get it in the movie store fast if you can.
Very good movie, one of the best movies. I see last one, I want To give you so many movies made so good

The Godfather: A movie without anything that needs to be changed. Indeed, when one sees the godfather, one doesn't have anything to criticize it. Their script is perfect, in fact, for me is one of the best screenplay ever written; the performances and the direction are also perfect: The performances are really wonderful, especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, accompanied with a marvelous cast; and the direction is amazing. Equally, the soundtrack, the decorations, the wardrobe and all that conforms the movie, is perfect; anything is in its place. The master sum in all their components, make The godfather an immortal and unforgettable movie. A master piece. An entire cinematographic lesson.
I really like this movie. Really admire the work of all the actors especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. I don't think there will ever be another movie like this. This movies was really just awesome!!
The Godfather is an undisputed masterpiece. Not only is this the greatest film ever made, it is also the greatest work of man-made art I have ever experienced. This defines what filmmaking is at its highest level. All cinephiles must watch this movie before they can claim they understand true cinema. I believe this film has arguably the 2 greatest performances in cinematic history -- 1 being Al Pacino as Michael Corleone and 2 being Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. Pacino's portrayal of Michael in the first 2 Godfather films is the greatest acting I have witnessed in my entire life. The Godfather is a work out art without flaw and a perfect film. 11 out of 10.
For me it isn't "the greatest ever", but it's still great For me it isn't "the greatest ever", but it's still great
The godfather was my first introduction to the organization and rules behind the Italian mafia. Only after that I started to see how this was crucial to success of a criminal organization. Sculpted like and inspired by the Roman empire is a method that really worked. It changed somewhat during the years, but my empire is still run in a similar way.

Great movie without too much overacting. Some of the shots even look too much like it was shot in an amateuristic live situation. Part 2 & 3 were a real addition and the trilogy is definitely worth watching.

The only drawback: They made it seem that crime doesn't pay. Nobody was happy and everybody died. Greatly exaggerated!

From the first until the Last only the Best of All the Past

This is the Movie You cant forget it you never forget its name or those scene this is the shortest 3 hour movie its very short & very hard and soft. Only the best of best

best actors best director best writer only best of best. Plays of Marlon Brando is Awesome His is the sensitive hard man even word make you confuse.

Al Pacino, A hard strong man stone heart man that you could see the good in it And Fredo a big dumb brother !!! like hell in hell!!! Gather of these With Work of the Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo Make the best of best.
A truly iconic epic movie. A must watch for fans of cinema.

The godfather is a great film that shows an accurate sense of crime during its time period. Almost very predictable but still very enjoyable, with many secrets through out the entire movie such as the oranges displayed before a death occurs is a very unique way to connect with the audience. This has been a favorite of mine since the first time I have seen it and it remains one of my favorite. Seems like a very hard movie to film with all of its different shots and angle throughout it keeps the audience on it toes and interested. I can watch this movie a hundred time and still be very interested. After watching it I left the room and i midfield expected to be shot down upon exiting the classroom. Once again just a fantastic movie and everyone should watch at least the first one.
I've never been so bored in my life like when i watched this movie. I started watching it with a big expectations due to what people say about it . But at the end, i ended up forcing my self to finish it. maybe because it's too old ? i don't know. The only good thing was the acting for sure. The main actor was a phenomenon.
I cant say much but for me the movie is not my type however i cant see anything that makes the movie not the best of its genre !

And of course one of the best films ever.
This is in my opinion, the true classic of American cinema. From the opening to the climax inter-cut with the baptism of Connie Corleone's son you will be riveted to your television screen. This is not, however, a fast-moving mob film like Martin Scorsese's work, but more of a drama. Also unlike Scorsese's work, this is more of a romanticised version of mob life, and you will grow to like the characters better because of this If Mafia films aren't your cup of tea I still recommend The Godfather as it depicts family life as well as Family life, showing how Don Vito keeps his family together through good and bad. In one word I would describe this film as - epic.

10/10 - Must see
When I watched the movie I had to close my eyes more than fifteen times because in some parts the scenes are very violent. I didn't get when it happened something that it was suppose to indicate the time passing. The script is well done, I think that the movie with a different script would have been very different. The photography is good for the time it was filmed. The actors killed it. I like the music although it was very repetitive. This is a very good movie but it isn't the type of movies I like, it's very violent. The sounds and scenes are very intense, all the sounds are well done according to the time, it would have been interesting if they added more sounds.
The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.
awesome movie. In mafia movies , but this film will only weapons and combat all processed very good script and acting. Processing of the rise and fall of a family . perfect crime and drama along with other films. A great movie that everyone should watch before you die. great processed as subject Marlon Brando was much better movie with great acting One of the few films awarded in three branches. The poverty of a man is the subject of short films and desire to stand against the influence of poverty and injustice is important to understand the ability to kill people and is proving its strength. It is a film that addresses the creation of a mob and growth
Mafia Movies be my biggest influence, i have to say that i love when film start quick in action, thats not the case for this one, but when its started , its started ...

A must see
As much as I would like to do justice for this movie - there is little I can say that will help people understand the grandeur of this film. The Godfather sends you through a riveting journey into the life of one of the five great families. And with a cast as breathtakingly awe-inspiring as this, you are bound to be on the edge of your seat from the very first wedding scene.

The plot of the movie is in itself fantastic, but it should not go unmentioned how it is not only a good movie - but a very realistic depiction of the harsh life of the criminal organizations, and their internal structure based mostly on nepotism.

The soundtrack (which is too often ignored as an important aspect of storytelling in these reviews) by Nino Rota perfectly underlines the true sadness of this intricate storyline.
Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself with The Godfather, probably the greatest movie in cinema history. Marlon Brando shows us his magnificent skills and his way of dominating the scene. The Don's relationship with his family is unique and incredibly well depicted. Looking at Brando's career, which is frighteningly impressive, to say the least, the role of Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt his best one. To say that Al Pacino was incredible in this movie and the rest of the trilogy would be an understatement. James Caan, in the role of Sonny, comes right after Brando and Pacino's stunning performances. Truly a masterpiece, The first part of this epic trilogy will forever be at the very top of my list.

Fist of all, you need to watch this movie, second of all, you need to watch this movie, and lastly, you need to watch this movie. If you die or fall of this planet without this movie then you will do a very injustice to your inner self, to your soul. The Godfather is like a bible if you want it for yourself. you get a philosophy out of this that will open your 3rd eye and you will start to care more, respect more, observe more and become more of what you really are.
One of my favorites of all time. Very good acting, story, filmography! And to think that I was filmed so long ago is just insane. absolutely love this trilogy!
Extremely Engrossing motion picture, that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money Extremely Engrossing motion picture, that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever.

I must say this film is the best mobster/gangster movie ever made. The acting is so superb , it was a crime that Pacino was not an Oscar winner for any of these classics! Al goes from an Ivy League College-Boy / War Hero to a cold, calculating mob boss and he does it all to the point where you not only believe the transformation, but applaud it as well ! This was also one of those rare times where the film was actually as good as the book ! And of course there's the music and costumes and vintage cars... it's all a treat for movie-lovers.. If you see only ONE "mafia" movie in your life, this MUST be it ! Forget everything you've read or heard about the violent scenes or the glorifying of crime, when it comes down to it, this film is about Family and Loyalty and sadly, the quest for Power and its affect on family and loyalty.
This masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola explores the Corleone family much deeper than just their business activity. It is worth watching every single second to really understand the complexity of the mob. In addition to a great plot, the acting is just superb.
A magnificent movie ever made about the Gangster life and its consequences. Equipped with some powerful dialouges..viz." I'll make him an offer he can't refuse", " Keep your friends close and your enemies closer", "It's nothing personnel sonny, it's strictly business". The camera angles are way great and I can't believe it is from early 70's. Coppola delivered the best of him.. The elements of the movie had been copied by various other movies in different languages... Marlon Brando and Al Pacino delivered the dialouges strikingly.... The Movie plot is really good...
As well as previous works by Bergman, Wilder, Huston, Hitchcock, Speilberg, Lucas, Kubrick, Capra, Gibson and other greats that touch our souls as only a film of this nature could while sitting in a theatre. If you don't keep this film in your heart and recognize it as the true mold for all others that took the same path, referencing it's style, you would be mistaken. It is on a different level, as the NBA's Michael Jordan is to most other players that came before him or have followed....Look up the word Classic in the dictionary and you should see a synopsis of this body of work along with Citizen Kane and others....Coppala, Pacino, Brando and Puzzo have created the starting point for others.... and their predecesors, can stand up and take notice and include them as one of the classics of all time......bc
Simply the best acting... cinematography by the great Gordon Willis.
Masterpiece, chef-d'oeuvre. One of the best films of all time.
This is the only i can watch a hundred times without getting tired it just by A+ rating!!!! For me everything was perfect!!!! The Godfather is my all time best. It starts out in a unique fashion, a story giving us an insight into the life of a mafia group and how it became a family business span of over three to four generations. This story is encapsulated with love, politics, religion, betrayal, trust and everything regular thing you can find in life. There has never been a movie like this that catches my attention like this one and there might not be another. I love the entire story and there was never a dull moment. I don't do any other thing while watching the Godfather it is not possible.I like the story, the cast, the everything.It's a must watch movie.
This is simply the greatest film ever made. It has everything from great cinematography to perfect acting. We all know of course that Marlon Brando brings his best performance here but so does every other actor. The greatness of this film cannot be undone and what makes it even better is the way it utilizes this. A story of backstabbing, honor, the mafia way of life and a lot of partying makes this film a true masterpiece.

I'm not gonna talk about the story since I'm pretty sure you already know it, if not then the other reviews will cover it. I do however want to point out that it may be simple on paper but is far more complicated once you see the film.

To summarize this i have to say I've never seen a more perfect film. Simply breathtaking!
this movie was so good I didn't pass out watching it I am so proud of myself thumbs up to me. this movie was so good I didn't pass out watching it I am so proud of myself thumbs up to me. this movie was so good I didn't pass out watching it I am so proud of myself thumbs up to me. this movie was so good I didn't pass out watching it I am so proud of myself thumbs up to me. this movie was so good I didn't pass out watching it I am so proud of myself thumbs up to me. this movie was so good I didn't pass out watching it I am so proud of myself thumbs up to me. this movie was so good I didn't pass out watching it I am so proud of myself thumbs up to me.
With several million hardcover and paperback books acting as trailers, Paramount's film version of Mario Puzo's sprawling gangland novel, "The Godfather," has a large pre-sold audience. This will bolster the potential for the film which has an outstanding performance by Al Pacino and a strong characterization by Marlon Brando in title role. It also has excellent production values, flashes of excitement, and a well-picked cast. But it is also overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as to be superior screen drama. This should not mar Paramount's b.o. expectations in any measure, though some filmgoers may be disappointed.
The best actors and screenwriters. I've seen the movie three times before. Worth seeing at least once.
If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone.
I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
There's no question this film will be considered a classic a century from now. One can only hope that an actor is born that will surpass Marlon Brando as the Godfather, or that a film that equally captures the American spirit will be made over the next 100 years.

This is one of the best movies of all time, for sure. The acting is astonishing, the cast is great and I can't wait to watch it again in the near future. It simply outstanding.

If you haven't watched the movie go watch it... seriously it has been out for 40 years dafuq have taken you so long. It's good. Pretty good. 10/10. Good ligthning. Great characters. Great original soundtrack. Great story. Great domestic violence. No this hasn't been a review yet. here it comes. The movie start out very promising and what makes it so great is that it continues having that great promise in mind and deliver it with such great impact. Like it's kinda like 5th impact in Neon Genesis Evangelion there never was a 4th but it jumps over the 4th and gets to the 5th right away like a great movie should. 10/10 avocado.

It's hard to watch this movie and not think about the mass effect it's had on our culture and cinema in general. Incredible story telling, brilliant acting, cinematography out of this world, and a general overall feeling of greatness. I watch this movie at least once a year and don't think there will be another like it.



I think many of the good reviews speak for themselves about why this movie is so beloved, but if you have some spare time, go ahead and read the reviews for the 1 Star ratings. Mostly you'll hear a bunch of rambling about how everyone who likes this movie has really low IQ, as they struggle to put coherent sentences together. Irony at its finest ladies and gentlemen.
Script is awesome, cast, directing, movie rocks forever.


I rarely deserve ten points for both dialogues and events I do not think you can watch movies Vito my father Allah mercy so tenth place and place their designs are so good that they go to Michael's Sicily Congratulations on how well I met you Mario Puzo I congratulate you on making a very successful production
The Academy Awards "Best Picture" is chosen by instant runoff voting. Instead of voting only for a single Best Picture nominee, Academy voters rank the nominees in order of preference. It is up to each voter to decide what criteria use in determining their order of preference.


Francis Ford Coppola brings to life one of the greatest crime novels ever, portraying Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, one of the best performances ever.

The Godfather is head of organized crime, run by his family, and is a very 'reasonable' man. He offers help to anyone who comes to him, expecting in return, only friendship. His denial to accept a narcotics deal gets him shot and although he survives, things are never the same again, with constant attempts to murder the bedridden Godfather. It is at this time when the family is losing power, that Michael Corleone, another brilliant performance by Al Pacino, slowly rises to power within the family. The rest is history.
The best movie of all time. Excellent acting and directing. When I first watch this movie I couldn't watch any other movie for long time, because all of others were crap. I can watch it for 100 times, but I will watch it for 101 time. People who doesn't like action movies, crime or mafia would love this movie, too. Just need to write this and tell everyone to watch this masterpiece.
You must watch this masterpiece. Absolutely watch...

While the plot of this movie is amazing, star cast is outstanding, cinematography and background music are masterpieces in themselves - the part which I like the most about this movie is how perfectly it depicts the influence of the cultural during those days over the society. The fine and minute details of lavishing lives of these underworld mafias, suppression of even elite women in almost every class of society and a lot more is put forth by this movie. The movie is full of twists and holds on to the audience. Your adrenaline level can be fairly high during these three and a half hours of your live. A must watch.
A wonderful film. I love the history, the actors, the director etc. This is one of the most wonderful movies of all time. One of my favorites. I believe that script, photography and direction are sensational. The effect The light and dark of the photo is fantastic. The talent of the actors is impressive.
10/10 "Things would have turned out better if we had only listened to the Godfather."
"Things would have turned out better if we had only listened to the Godfather." 10 out of 10
This is one of the best movies ever. A lot of powerful men. Also great actors who play in this movie. This a movie I can watch over and over again. I recommend this movie. Although the movie is about gangsters, there's still a lesson to be learned from this movie. There is a price to pay for being a criminal. Every good dog has its good and bad days.
Masterpiece is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but this movie truly lives up to that title.
Like most classic pieces of art - time reveals all flaws -- and this film shines bright after all these years. Pure gold!
What a masterpiece, hope this all movie series will never be forgotten and every person who respects and deserves honor should have all collection at home. Greatest actors of all times played their parts Perfect! A movie means a lot of emotion. The perspective of life is very decisive in a 'Capo' life like Godfather's because danger strikes at every time when you aspect the most little of all. I'd love to see the movie over and over again, the originality hidden underneath it is barely visible. I hope that every person who wants a lesson for life could watch this masterpiece and see the hardest moments in life are made for toughness, to go in battle with life and win the battle, or at least try to . I wish i could've been in those years when the life was a lot more tougher than it is nowadays. Look at all the people that don't give respect but are pretending to have it but they do not do a thing for having it. Anyway, a masterpiece will heavily remain in our hearts among these special actors.
This movie set's the stage for all gangster movies, the unity in the families in what I called Gangster style love. I could watch this movie over and over again, I only wish to that could recreate a movie like the God father ... I love it Mannnnnn


The movie is Wonderful an impressive movie is a lot of emotions
Mindblowing piece of masterpiece. It can't be much better. Perfect cast ,excellent acting. Everything was perfect about this movie. Thats why we say it one of the greatest movies of all time. They all nailed it. These type of movies come only once in a while. Hats off. I am just dowmloading part 2 and going to watch it soon. I don't think this type of movie wwill ever be made again. Even 10 points are less for this movie.

This is a film that has to be seen by everyone.it might seem long or boring at times but once you finish it you will not want to leave the universe of the Carleones.
Slogan: a movie of a lifetime Wow. The best movie I have ever seen. Period. If you have seen this movie you shouldn't be allowed to rate others, because it will influence your rating so much. Watch it.
The Godfather is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm going to be one of those annoying people and say that the book is better than the movie, but the movie was still great. I've seen this movie multiple times and each time it gets better and better. I appreciate the fact that the movie stuck to the family business more than the book did, because that was one of the weak parts of the book when they talked about that one girls vagina for a couple chapters. Both the movie and the book were great though and I would recommend them to absolutely anybody who's looking for a good mafia movie that has an actual story and isn't just a bunch of random shooting.
Took many tries to get threw it but still a must see
It is certainly one of the best films ever made in the movies, it really is a shame that it is difficult to produce movies these days. with such an engaging story. I miss the Mafia-themed movies nowadays, it would be nice to write about how the Mafia acts today in the world because it is a little explored theme nowadays.

But Oldman also sinks deeply and empathically into Churchill's lower ebbs, projecting a sagging, load-bearing frailty and eloquence-sapping indecision we less readily associate with this semi- mythical figure. As foreign secretary Viscount Halifax (Dillane, once more compelling as a grey, rigid man of power) politically manoeuvres against him, we see Churchill flag and flounder. Not only is it impressive evidence of Oldman's dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it's also a timely reminder that world leaders should pause,
This classic has lasted the test of time. Always great to watch.
This film has been a major favorite.. Loved every single part of the film
From the very first seconds, this film displays a sense of majesty. The performances are spot on - especially Al Pacino & Marlon Brando. The wonderful prolonged wedding scene that opens the film sets a standard for all other film makers. The Godfather theme song is tremendous - the most haunting ever. The interplay between all actors is of the highest standard and the "look" of the film is convincing & classy. This film marks the highpoint of American cinema and although films like Good Fellas and Field of Dreams have come close, the general standard of US films since The Godfather has been in gradual decline. Truly a masterpiece.
This movie in particular got me interested in cinema and being in front of the camera. Though I have 34% Italian blood in me, though it doesn't look like it, I always aspired to portray an Italian character. I can say- hands down- this movie inspired me to act be one the screen!

Big al pacino fan one of the best actors in the world
The Godfather is a not just a film but its a movement, it defines the past of the Italian American culture. A past that many American Italians are ashamed of but a past that I think the American people should know about. Any Italian could tell you that the principles of family that are portrayed in this film reflect the traditions of the old country. Family comes first before anything, this is a value that is passed down from generation to generation in the Italian culture, it was good to see that Coppola portrayed this in such a strong manner. It takes filming to a whole new level and changed the way we see films. Brando, Deniro and Pacino are genius! The acting compliments the impeccable work of Francis Ford Coppola. In my books this is a must see film, the book is not so bad either. The work of Coppola makes a long film seem like minutes.
You have not lived if you haven't watch this film. I think we all have put gum or paper in our jaws and pretended to be the God Father. Needless to say the cast was great in this film. This film will never get old. Kids in 2020 will still watch this film. Now this is film that can have sequels with no problem.
Perhaps the greatest movie ever made. Growing up i watched this movie more than a hundred times, and still.. never ceases to amaze me.

The honor and morality of ruthless kilers, the cold and in the same time warm atmosphere. The clash between the top actors (Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall) and the newcomers (Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, John Casale, James Caan). This movie is a school in acting and directing, and a pure sample of how a flawless movie should be.

Everything perfect.
How many times have I seen this movie? I enjoyed so much. This film is very popular in Iran. Although a lot of films have been made in these years, this film is one of the best films of the 1980s

A movie that has been watch through different generations and still finding a place among the best. A true classic that will always be interesting to watch again.
Such a good movie, i can always watch this movie when it comes on TV, one of my personal favorites.
Having watched the film only once maybe my opinion isn't the best but I really enjoyed it. Everything that you would expect from a classic New York gangsta film and all the characters fit their role perfectly. I love how Al Pacino slowly becomes more and more involved in the family and sometimes we have to do things we don't want to.

Just a classic film.
One of the best movies you'll ever watch. Amazing acting and great story line
This is a wonderful film I really enjoyed this movie
A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.
I know it is such a cliché to say it after thousands of comments, but this is a must-watch movie. You probably have seen all the impostors around acting like Marlon Brando which is funny of course but still it strikes you because of how much effort he put to pull off this movie. Although it might get boring sometimes, the acting and the sense of reality wind you up with the plot making it an easy-to- watch movie. Just to give you some heads-up, the first movie of the sequel can elevate the expectations for the rest, you won't regret for the time you spared for this movie. The plot is designated so well that it encircles you in every way not letting you stop or look away from the screen. In my opinion this is the best mafia-related movie in which all the racketeers and kingpins do not cut a swath and you admire even to the ones who die during the movie. Long story short, this movie definitely deserves its place among the top three in all time favorite movies.
For a film that is almost 50 years old now, the story is brilliant, the acting, sensational especially from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. I watched this movie for the first time about 2 weeks ago now and wish I had seen it sooner. There are very few films that I would give a 10/10 to but the godfather takes the cake with the cherry on top, for those who like a good story, brilliant acting, a bit of the mafia, guns blazing, this is your cuppa, it certainly is mine. Utterly incredible, now I just need to watch part 2 and 3!
Nothing need to say.. Acult movie. Best permformances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino
One of my favorite movies. I used to watch it all the time. It is and always will be a classic.
At least it is touted that way. But can we appeal to someone who says it's a poem?
I will keep my review to a minimum as so much has been written on this film. It is a fantastic film (up there with Once Upon a Time in the West as one of the greatest of all). I watched it again for the 8th time after not seeing it for 5 years or so, and had forgotten just how immersive the film is. My only negative comment, and I add this as I haven't heard this criticism before, is that this is one of the few films that would benefit from being a little longer. At times the film cuts between scenes too quickly and speeds through threads looking almost cartoony, which is at odds with the general mood of the film of a slow relaxed immersive experience. In particular consider when Tom visits Hollywood to get Johnny Fontane a role. The sequence seems almost rushed as one minute Tom is in NY then LA and then cut, cut, cut suddenly there's a horse's head.. This happens a number of times in the film and probably resulted from studio pressure to reduce the film's running length. Overall though a masterpiece.

There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.
This is a must see for any movie buff, actor, or artist.
One of the best... must watch this one 100 percent
Greatest Movie of All Time! You have to see this movie before you die. You have to see this movie if you are starting out in the acting/directing industry.
If you ever had to choose a movie for any positive reason whatsoever, choose this movie. This movie is something that is a guaranteed must see before you die. One of the GOATs.
They are perfect I ve been watchin 10 times.

Sos succesfull team, director actors and actress and screen plan wonderful

congrats to all.
Easily the greatest movie I have ever seen. If you ever have a chance to watch this movie, TAKE THE CHANCE! Definitely worth watching.
Awesome movieeeeeeeeeee I like these kind of moviessssssssssssssss
What can I say about this picture? All I can say is that this is one of the greatest films ever made. Everything about is great; the story, the acting, directing, the script and of course the wholesome dark and mysterious atmosphere. Every film buff has to watch this movie at least once in his lifetime; it is that damn good!
Overestimated, } They didn't explain what illness the old Don Corleone had, didn't show the deaths of other family owners ... and the party scenes could be much smaller, and could have more intense dialogues...

Thats all .
Incredibleahuifhuiasvfiaogfvhaiuhvbasidgv9uiasghviusaghhgigfiuagiughaiufhai the best
This movie is great, although it is not perfect. Growing up i would always hear that this is the greatest movie of all time, and when i finally sat down to watch it I had a blast. Its filled with many great performances, great cinematography, and etc. The reason I am giving it a 7 is because i feel it has a pacing issue, theres a lot of unneeded shots and not every performance was believable.
This is one of the greatest creations of the cinema history! I don't know how many times I have watched this! San T
Omg this movie is a masterpiece and I will never forget the soundtrack in film and I will never forget this film ever Thank you Francis Ford Coppola
I mean I expected this movie to make me bored within the first 20 minutes but instead it was great and I loved how the story line always kinda kept you guessing and always seemed to keep going and never seemed to end, but obviously in a good way because it kept me on the edge of my seat.
The book is awesome, one of the best books ever. Sadly the movie is weak, and fails to portrait the true essence of the characters, what's so great about the book is that you're able to know and understand the background stories, therefore you identify with the characters behavior to the point where you even forget they're mobsters!! however in the movie many minor and irrelevant scenes take too much time, time that could be used to go a little deeper into the characters, and what's even worst is the total disregard to important passages of the book which didn't even make the movie, or if they did, they were over-synthesized. I don't think I'm the only one that really loved the book, but was sadly disappointed by the movie, still is a movie worth watching, but if you really want to enjoy a great story you should read the book!!
Watch it and you'll know it. Great casting, great direction, great storytelling.
What a incredible movie, this is the movie of the century, i have watched it three times, 10 out of 10, masterpiece, well deserved Oscar, i loved everything about this movie
This movie is awesome in every detail . The actors make the best movie ever. The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's "threshold". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando.

Hawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners,
This is a must see film for anyone at least once in your lifetime. A true masterpiece that was brilliantly written with an All Star cast!
Well I Wonder More About What Michael Angelo Is Doing As Fact, But When It Is Time For A Demonstration For Movies; I Think Of The Fiction Mario Decided To Write For Michael In The Godfather. So It Is A Great Example Of The Creative Mentality Amongst Italian People During The Modern 20 Century.
My favorite movie, and it is really classic. Even it is 40+ years since 1972, you can hardly find one which could hit you or your soul like The Godfather.
I love the concept and headline for this , it was a great background and plot
Nice to see the movies & learn lot of thinks..........................................................................................
This movie is a classic. When you think of all time best movies Godfather definitely comes to mind. The director, writers, actors & everyone else who had a part in making this movie are genius's. I think Godfather will be a classic 100 years from now. I just called 4 people & asked my husband the same question. .."What are the top 3 best mob or gangster movies of all time? " They ALL said Godfather & Scarface. 2 said Good fellows too. So it's not just my opinion. A lot of people know that this movie was one of the best movies ever! I may not be a movie critic or an actor, my daughter is an actor though & I know that ever since she has been acting, I actually pay attention to if someone really is a good actor or not & Godfather is full of awesome actors. After sitting in on many acting classes with my daughter I can tell a great actor! Thank you for making such a classic movie that will never get old. No matter how many times you watch it, it never gets old.
The best movie thanks for helping me to watch this
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them. BRILLIANT FOR ME 8/10
I could not take this movie seriously. If I had watched it without knowing what it was maybe I would have given it some thought but the way the people died was so funny to me.
Vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
I havemt acutally seen the movie, but i heard its preety good, definitely worth a watch
Nothing really can be said about these movie... it's truly the best of all time
"Godfather". " never hate you enemies it affects your judgement" aye this movie is best gangsta movie that you would ever see . The cast is best i, 2 great actors in 1 ,Al Pacino and Marlon Brando 2 Oscar winners combined how could "Godfather" be boring for god's sake ? 9/10
Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.

Godfather contains drama,crime and u will find twist here.Slow movie but u have to rate it after seeing
I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined. i love how the scenes are laid out. i love old movies and I love romance films mixed with thriller. So this is definitely one of my all time favorites. I would recommend it to anyone young and old. There are some intense scenes as well. I would love to one day be in a movie sort of like this. But it would add such a flavor that people wouldn't expect it. I also like the idea of a super natural being who has many sides that we haven;t fully figured out. I am a movie lover and this is by far one of my favorites. I think when creating my own trailer I want to take small hints of sadness and hope like this film and include it in mine

Love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people.
A film that makes people think about life. I'm so glad I watched it before I died.

A timeless film, so current at the time it was made as it is today, magnificently presents us with the backbone of a system that still remains, a corrupt system, the film also speaks of betrayal, family, and above all, Friendship.
Ok but long story and get a bit boring on some pont
One of the ever-lasting legends in the age of science!

The Godfather (1972) has a lot of terrific mood, one great performance by Pacino, an excellent character segue by Brando, and a strong supporting cast.

I can watch this amazing piece of direction again and again! And you should watch this as well

This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
Through the years I kept hearing about "The Godfather" and how wonderful it was and all of that. I saw the video at the library and finally decided to see what the hype was all about. Am I glad I did! It was one of the best movies I have seen. I stayed up past midnight (which is unusual for me) to watch it because I just couldn't turn it off.

I think the one scene that sticks with me the most (along with the horse's head of course) is the baptism scene. To hear Michael saying "I do" to accepting God and rejecting Satan while you see all these assassinations being carried out by his orders gave me the chills. I can't wait to see the other two!
No doubt about it, this a spectacular viewing experience. The acting along with the storyline makes this film a genuine masterpiece. The film covers a wide spectrum of genre keeping the viewer entertained throughout. TOP CLASS!
I'll keep it short, this movie is perfect. The performances of all the actors involved, the many memorable scenes, the musical score. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and see it. Well worth the #1 ranking.
Despite hearing about what a classic this is I hadn't seen this until now. All I can say is Wow!! I didn't know how lucky I was before to miss this but now it is too late and I will never get those 3 hrs of my life back. The acting is cheesy and the story is so simple and shallow, those who thinks there is a deeper meaning must be thinking too hard. I suppose a recent comparable movie would be 2012, but at least that had some ridiculous special effects, all this had was some really bad acting. The best parts were a couple of LOL moments during the shooting scenes, otherwise this has got to be one of the most boring movies ever and I fell asleep at least 5 times.

Definitely the best movie I have ever seen. All my friends say it's a sick gory film and it's just about men shooting each other. Well they're wrong. It rocks!!! Al Pacino is my favourite actor in the whole world and he plays this character to perfection. I first saw this film when I was 10 (seven years ago) and can't stop watching it ever since. It's not about the crime and the underworld. It's about a family who have the strongest ties to each other and respect each other. It's about family values and issues and who you put first. I've also seen 2 & 3 and they are also cool films but certainly don't come close to this blockbuster.
This is my favorite movie. This on the surface is a movie about the Mafia, but if you scratch the surface, you realize this is a movie about family and about the consequences of being loyal to your family. Michael in the beginning is an all-American war hero, who is obviously not part of the family business. Michael transforms so subtly into a murderous, remorseless man, that you don't even notice it until the very end. Every actor is perfect, Brando gives the performance of his life. If you have not seen this movie(or even if you have), go rent it at the video store, make some pasta and spaghetti sauce, and enjoy!
What more could you ever want from a film?! The Godfather, created by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is an absolutely mind boggling film. The acting is brilliant! Brando, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall are masterful actors. The topic, the mafia, fascinating. The motif and symbolism (shaded eyes, oranges for death), stunning and so well presented. The transitions (edition), genius. Most of all, watch for the wonderful cinematography...Coppola knows how to shoot a hell of a film! I personally don't believe any other film can compare to this movie. Truly a masterpiece and revolutionary in setting higher standards in filmmaking.

The Godfather is an engrossing movie about how one man is slowly drawn into the mob and into a life of crime. Marlon Brando plays mafia boss Don Vito Corleone who is shot down early in the movie. The movie then goes on to show how his son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is entangled in the world of crime. This movie is one of the best ever made and has many scenes that are so complex and thought provoking that it, at times, gives me chills. The Godfather is a movie that should eventually be seen by everyone and I highly recommend it.
The Godfather movie has to be the greatest movie of all time. Al Pacino is the greatest actor of all time. The story takes you through a rollercoaster ride of feelings and raw imagery.

Meagre words can not describe the greatness felt while watching The Godfather... all three of them to be precise.
The Godfather has been and will stay in my heart as one greatest films of it's type(mob). It tells a complete story with background about Vito's unfortunate life as a boy.

I like it!
I watched this film because it had a high user rating. I don't get why people find it a good film. For me, it was just a film about people, a family, killing other people. I couldn't take much more away from it than that, sorry. Shawshank is a much better film in every respect. The Godfather is long and drawn out and although it is one of the better gangster films, I would have to say that it is not one that I will watch again. Please let there be someone that agrees with me. From the reviews that I have read there doesn't seem to be a good reason to suggest why this film is voted number one, something that really puzzles me. There are no twists, little to think about, and the film hardly makes you feeling better at the end of it, does it? I've seen much better films than the Godfather although I'm sure, as I seem to be going against popular opinion, I will get heavily criticized for these comments.
If there is one movie that I can say have touched me more than any other I would have to say The Godfather has. It is more than just a movie to me. It is a movie that I will never grow tired of, and will never forget. I enjoy movies like Casino, and Goodfellas, but they can't compare to The Godfather, but to me The Godfather isn't just some mob movie. It is a flawless masterpiece of family and the life of crime. Each actor seems perfect for his role. The Baptism scene is one the greatest scenes in the whole movie. I don't know how to make this review flashy or stand out, but all I can say is that if you are a movie lover, and are easily touched by movies then you will love The Godfather whether you like Mob movies or not. Just a classic.

This movie is well deserved of its glittering reputation. It simply blows its would-be contenders of the same genre (ie. Goodfellas, Casino etc.) out of the water. It is perfect in every way, from the flawless acting to the stunning cinematography. I think you would be hard pressed to find a Marlon Brando movie, an Al Pacino movie, a James Caan movie, a Robert Duval movie or a Diane Keaton movie where they turn out a better performance. And I think that the credit for all of this has to go to the films director, Francis Ford Coppola. And anyone who tries to tell you that this movie is anything less that the greatest single piece of cinema of all time simply does not know what they are talking about (although the Godfather part 2 comes extremely close...). So I plead with you, please, please, please go out and rent (or even better, BUY!) this film, even if you have read the book (although if you have done that I suspect you will have seen the movie too!) because I guarantee you will fall in love with it.
Easily the finest cinematic experience ever. I thought the book would be impossible to beat, but was wrong. Thank you to MP, FFC and the great cast who made this the most awesome film experience imaginable. Some things are better off forgotten and others stay with you. The Godfather is a once in a lifetime event; acting understated, settings and plot flow superb. Sequels were good also, but the original can't be beat.

Let the film speak for himself. those who've seen him understand me. perfectly told, a great intensity marvelously shot, great cinematography

About a month ago , i found the trilogy of The Godfather on tape, it was at a cheap price so i bought it. It was one of the best purchases i have made this year. This is THE best trilogy of all time. Even if you dont like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino or James Caan's other movies, you should check out this one, it is great , i hope you will enjoy it has much has me.
If and when the world comes to an end, I truly hope a copy of the Godfather is found among the ruins. This movie of which I have seen over 100 times since it's release in '72 has displayed the best of a well put together story about family. This family just happens to be into organized crime. If you have never seen the movie, rent it and relax and let yourself be taken away by the gripping story which is nonstop from beginning to end (of course Godfather II picks up right where this one stops). a 10 in my book now and forever.
The Godfather, released in 1972, is still the basic guideline for any other mafia movie or any other movie released since. The acting from Al Pincho, James Cann, and Marlon Brando are some of the best acting I've seen since Citizen Kane and The Big Sleep. This movie deserves to be on be the number one movie at imdb.com and is number one in my book for favorite movie of all time.
I am a huge movie fan and all my friends know that this film is my most favourite. Every performance is superb and every line is a classic. The images are the work of a great cinematic artist and the unforgettable score perfectly frames his work. I have watched this movie many times and look forward to many more viewings. Truly, the greatest crime movie ever made.
Being a young man I have not been blessed with being able to see The Godfather when it was originally released, and the thought of seeing this epic on the big screen makes me drool. The story is what drives this masterpiece, not special effects like todays so called epics. I was glued to the my television, watching this film. After you watch this film you find yourself whistling the main theme, and going around talking like Don Corleone. It is a great movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone tired of todays movies with no story.
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 41 years old and has aged well.

This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.
"The Godfather",and lots of people will agree with me,is the greatest movie ever made.there aren't many people who didn't see that movie,there aren't many people who won't see that movie more then once.

it is hard to explain what there is in that movie that makes it so great.maybe it's the directing,maybe it's the wonderfull players,maybe it's the music,maybe it's mario puzo's great story about the Italian mafia family and it's life in America,and maybe it's the mix of all of them together.it's never mind. what do mind,is Francis Ford Coppola,that in his own way managed to create one of the most excellent art works in the history of humanity. this movie gets eaziely a rank of 10 out of ten stars.
Before seeing Godfather for the first time I had never seen a serious movie like that. I was only 13 and my tastes haden't quite matured yet. Since then, I've developed a great love for the movies. The Godfather has led me to such classics as Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and many more. But Godfather, in my eyes, is the best of them all.
This is probably one of the finest films I've ever seen. Truly it's a classical masterpiece of cinematography and really gripping plot. This movie not only launched the careers of the actors, but also affirmed the heavyweights as well. It beautifully portrays the value of family, with romance, politics, and certainly blatant war. Yet, the movie is almost poetic, with violent scenes that don't drench you in gore, and a language that isn't in your face. Simply put, it's what every great action/drama film should be. A must-see for every true film goer.
I've seen nearly 40 of the top 50 films on the AFI list, and although I'm no authoritarian on the subject I say without a doubt this is the most profound film in memory. If not for the fact that this movie is about Italians, better yet corrupt ones this would have been #1 on any virtually any reputable list. Everything comes together, there is no flaw. Citizen Kane was also brilliant, but it had flaws. How often is there a Godfather reference on tv? in a conversation? I can talk to anyone for hours about this film. This is the standard, this is the benchmark.
Based on the old style Sicilian mafia, Francis Ford Coppola directs Mario Puzo's novel "The Godfather" into the dramatic tale of Sicilian Godfather Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Coppola and Puzo convey the importance of loyalty to the family, the cost of betrayal, and ever-present power of organized crime rings.
It;s either "Boring and far too long" or "The best film ever!". The crucial factor in these two opinions of 'The Godfather' is...intelligence. The Godfather is an intricate, clever, brilliantly scripted movie. Those of us who have the brains to understand it see its beauty, those who dont, cant. Its only downfall is that it is possibly too clever for all to enjoy which is a shame.
Spectacular performance from Al Pacino. It's not only about the mafia, the crime nor the ambitions of men, it's about the family. Many people has argued that the Godfather is in reference to Brando and some would disagree and say it was Pacino. See the movie and judge for yourself. Two thumbs up!!!
It's a movie with an intense, intense storyline.

This movie slowly progresses and gradually becomes more and more intense until the end of the story.

This is one of my favorite movies.

The Godfather is a very well produced film, with excellent acting, cast, script and direction. He will certainly be assisted by generations of people, who will have a notion of how the Mafia was in the 1940s. A striking feature in my opinion is the value Don Vito Corleone gives his family. Everyone should see this movie!
Cinematography is excellent Acting is the most fantastic from brando & pacino Excellent from the others And very excellent from director mr Coppola
This movie is my most favourite movie and for good reasons, first of all kudos to the actors in this movie and Marlo Brando for smashing it outside the stadium.

As for the plot, the mafia family crime thriller drama intrigued me so much, the directing style of Frank Ford Coppola, the mesmerizing scores help to elevate the movie watching experience more than anything.

A MUST WATCH.
Great movie...i love it . The film is about real life in past in america. It was a very strange society.
One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece.
Really classic. Magnificent portrait of organized crime. A must-see gangster movie.
For those critics who are against violent Mafia films and choose not to watch them, that is fine, but it should be considered that there is more to this movie than meets the eye. Above all else, it is the story of a father trying to repent for the sins of the past and trying to keep his sons from avoiding the same mistakes that he has made.
This is a classic and should be watched all the way through!!! Al Pacino is amazing

I like this movie and the director. You need to watch it more than 3 times
This movie was incredibly boring. It kinda had me in the start but lost me afterwards. I guess it's goos in other aspects of filmmaking but I watch a movie for entertainment.
A must see. It is a classic and the story, the cinematography, and everything above make this such a masterpiece.
An important place in American history is the period when several thousand Sicilian emigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life, in which there would be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxich dons. Who knew at that time that this "bunch of Sicilian emigrants" would occupy a high place in the United States and in the history of this country.
Although when it comes to movies Goodfellas prefer mafia, Godfather can not deny that's the best movie about the mafia, maybe the best movie ever made .An impeccable direction of Francis Ford Coppola's part and a great script based on the book Mario Puzo's (who is also co-author of the screenplay) make an excellent movie .Jocul nose is high-class actors, Marlon Brando makes perhaps the best role of his career, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall are excellent and roles but it is curious that none of them earned Oscar statuette going to Joel Grey in Cabaret role, but whatever, it is so decided Academy members, who we eventually his Godfather is a conclusion contestam.In excellent movie that I recommend to all, although I do not think there's anyone who has not seen .not 10 course.
Do yourself a favour, and just watch it for gods sake.
I dont know what can I to say , I just like it and I'm so lucky , watched this movie , and I call "Absurd" what I like . :)
Well it is the best film about how humans protecting their family!
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. "Citizen Kane" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did "Gone With the Wind" or "2001: A Space Odyssey". "The Godfather" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.

I love this movie! Sense of family and brotherhood given in this movie!
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
I see him every time I have the opportunity. One of those films that lets you live the atmosphere and the action with the actors.
The godfather is a great movie to watch with the fellas. Its a must watch movie if your into mob movies. Something to watch on a Saturday night. 3 hours long but worth every minute of it.
Boss film long but you get Takin in to thie r world
Hi,I just signed up to write a review for Godfather movie. I would say, this is the best movie I have ever seen in my life.

The best crime killer all time and I must say master work no other film has done such a wonderful job like this film.

The title says it all, I saw it by the first time four months ago and then I couldn't help seeing the whole trilogy. The characters are bold and well personified by the Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and others of a cast that was never assembled again.

Then other movies came along in the Mob-Crime genre. I felt immersed in this world or may I say underworld and took the ride till the very end.

Incredible it is to say that to watch this now it gave me the sensation that was an actual film, the reason it is that this working piece it is an a unique coalition of talents that will revive this film again and again for any generation that watches it.

I recommended it!


Thanks for the cool movie it's the best i love to watch it again and again
I loved this movie a lot and i watched it more than once
Wonderful movie and one of the greatest films ever made
Very good good good asdafzxczxcsdffgdfxz sdsadxc zxczxdsd xcazsd xcxcasd
One of the best ganasters movie ever, thanks to my dad i know about this movie, love it
This is one of my all time favourite movies. I loved it. The acting by Brando and Pacino is superb in my opinion.
Brilliant screenplay backed with awesome character development and Wonderful Acting by Marlon Brando
Actually Sonny's car is a 1940 or 1941 Lincoln Continental.

When Michael rides in the 1941 Buick with McClusky and Sollozo, notice that the steering wheel shows a lot of wear on the rim, and the rear window panes are starting to delaminate- this is indicated by the odd shapes on lower inner corners of the glass. This would not occur on a car less than 10 years old (at the time of the scene), but certainly would on a car that was over thirty years old.

Sonny's shooting was actually filmed on an airport runway, but the toll booths are exactly as I remember as I grew up on Long Island. I first saw The Godfather in a theatre in Roslyn, Long Island and got pulled over by a cop on the way there so I missed the first 20 minutes! It's still my favourite film.

Beautiful movie by all standards. Old but great and all need to watch.
This movie manipulates the human psycology with an excellent way
One of the best movies of all time! ;D

this movie was one of the influences for me to join the filmmaking industry, the lighting. the setting and mainly the characters.
This movie deserves the best score and the best reviews. No one could ever represent the world of mobsters better than Coppola did. Every single character, or almost everyone, is represent and told in every single aspect: his life, his emoticons, his role in the family (the apoteosis of mobsters families of all time). The movie succeeds in being very intersting and always exciting, altough very long. A piece of history, the perfettina!
The Godfather has to be the best movie of all time. It not only captivates the criminal aspect but the loyalty and business savvy of a mafia family. This movie is also great because it was the rock of many careers of our most notable and best actors and actresses. Al Pacino, Abe Bagoda, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppala, Marlon Brando, and James Caan along with many others. Now whenever you see an organized crime movie anywhere it will be compared to the mafia story. This movie also teaches you some important roles to live by. Be careful who you trust. Also keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. If you haven't seen The Godfather trust me "it's an offer you can't refuse."
You may see it silly but remember that this movie has been made in 1972
The Godfather the best film ever i like it so much
I'm support this movie. Ones of the best movie creations of film creating in the past decade.
Without undue emphasis, it shows the closeness, the warmth of family ties. The scenes are filled with wives and squalling babies, festive weddings and equally festive funerals, spaghetti prepared in the kitchen. There is the flavor of Italian home life that few gangster films have attempted. At the same time, there is also a specificity in the persona that few films have dared.

Which crooner was separated from whose orchestra on a friendly suggestion from the Godfather? And which movie producer was induced to hire him for a war movie by finding the head of his favorite horse in bed with him one morning? (Here, literary hyperbole may have embellished the facts, but it makes an effective, blood-curdling scene.)
Best noir drama, cinematography is like painting best exile to study lighting and colour palate should really study and enjoy this film
Impressive. The Godfather is a more important film, of course it is. But The Godfather Part II is a better film. It's more ambitious, it's more elegiac, it delves deeper into the soil of Italian-American myth, plus... what were they thinking of, trying to match the critical and commercial dynamite of the first film? The Godfather Part II was, from conception upwards, an insane project. But it worked. When I watched this movie I was amazed that how Robert de Niro nailed the role of Don Vito Corleone. It could be a pressure for any actor to play a role of it has been played by a famous and good actor before. And most problem to play younger Don was that it was played by the god of cinema: Marlon Brando.

The Godfather is one of the best movies I ever watched
This is a Great Trilogy. True film about a sicilian gangsters.
The greatest movie ever. I think it deserves 10 out of 10 stars.
Amazingly planned and put together, not a big fan of films personally but this is defo worth a watch!!
This should have won the acadamy award for best movie ever made. It has awesome action. I think that everybody did a great job on it. Marlon Brandon deserved the Oscar he won. He did a great job on his role. My favorite character in the movie is James Cann's role "Sonny Corleone". He did a great job in it. Especially when he kicked Carlo's ass. Al Pacino also did a good job in it. I really liked him in this. It is my favorite role of his(this and Scarface).I believe Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Francis Ford Copppla did a great job. He brought in great acting assemble for this movie. He pretty much started Al Pacino's amazing career. Everybody remembers James Cann for his role, and the same for Marlon Brando's role. CHICA CHICA YEAH!

BJK
I usually don't like movies before 1995 for several reasons, maybe because I'm younger and I'm used to the movies of the 2000's. All I can say is that it's the only "old" movie that impressed me. And I realized why it is seen as one of the best movies. It's one of those movies that you have to see in your lifetime.
It is by far the most intense, reality based movie I have ever seen. If you've never seen Al Pacino, this is the the movie to begin with.
This film is very good for my wacht film. importantly this film is mafia part
The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. Director: Francis Ford Coppola Writers: Mario Puzo (screenplay by), Francis Ford Coppola (screenplay by) 1 more credit » Stars: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan See full cast & crew »
I have seen this movie dozens of times and want to see it dozens more.
Just pure class. Nothing much to say than the film of all films.
Best movie ever, I love it so much! I enjoy every moment, every second
As the name of this masterpiece implies, Godfather is truly the Godfather of Mafia Film. Every cliche and idea that has been introduced into movies and TV shows based around the Mafia have elements that were first introduced in the Godfather and its sequels. And the Godfather's influence does not only lay in English speaking countries. For example, as someone of Turkish descent, I have noticed that many of Turkey's mafia-based TV shows are influenced by this masterpiece.
The Best Movie I Ever Seen In my entire Life I don't Know its Just Awesome !!

It's a good film i love it because it's show my life.thank you for make this film.I love you.
One of my favourite movie of all time!! I really enjoy the role of Marlon Brando.
Amazing film and the shot was cinematic. I love to watch always.

This was a great film. i encourage others to watch them all.

Iconic film and great contribution in the world cinema. This was one cinema which has the casting, cinematography, editing and direction on point. You pause on any frame throughout the film you feel something asethic about the frames.
During Roth's birthday party, the pattern on his shirt changes. Due to weather difficulties, the two minute scene took over a week to shoot and the original shirt was lost at some point.
This movie is a perfect balance with the drama and old, i love it, really,
My favourite movie , brilliant classic could watch this over and over , hell I have warn out my DVD collection of Godfather lol absolutely brilliant 😍 💥 💯 I have the limited edition best purchase I have made 🙋😁
One of my brothers all times favourite. Classic. I dont remember much about it but cinema was way different than what is now. Movies with such intensity and character are jewels of history.
I was initially cynical before watching this movie; I thought it would be hard for it to justify such a high average rating. Having now watched all three, the first Godfather is by far the best, and deserves the title of one of the 3 or 4 greatest movies of all time. The acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is incredible, and this movie has immersed me in the world and created a level of suspense and anticipation that I have not felt before with any other piece of cinema. Without spoiling any of the plot, the twists and turns and overall composition of the movie is spectacular; although it is 3 hours long, you end up never wanting it to end. I think a lot of credit needs to go to Mario Puzo for his incredibly intelligent plot in the first instance, and overall this is a must watch.
The Best Movie in History, its a beautifully crafted gangster film that highlights faith, family, and power. A lesson in filmmaking is sampled from many ivy league and big ten schools to highlight a new direction in storytelling in American cinema.
Not as I expected, this movie showed me one of the greatest actors I've ever seen such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, etc.. but I didn't see that the story is great. Also, there was a problem with the time in this movie, you have to watch the first 18 minutes of the wedding scene which was so boring to be completely honest. Also, the story didn't show me the past of Vito Corleone, which I saw in The Godfather: Part II. The event of this movie was so slow and the story in some scenes becomes boring and not understandable. So, I give this Masterpiece (What people call it) 6.5 to 7 stars out of 10.
A cinematic Masterpiece. Every character is incredible and diverse and other movies should strive to be this great.

Being somewhat a film connoisseur I have watched my good share of movies. But for me, nothing beats Godfather. The emotional drama, the family centric-theme, the backstabbings and - of course the crime setting sets for a intriguing movie... A movie I would recommend to anyone, because I think everyone will get something out of it. As it works on so many different levels. 10/10
The BEST Mob movie of all time. With all the Drama Character changes from beginningto end and the performances done by the cast makes the movies just Breathtaking. This movie was released on March 24th 1972. Even that early in the year you knew that is was going to be the best movie of the year and that Marlon Brando had the best performance all year. It was such a good movie that before they finished filming they planned The Godfather Part II. Another good thing about this movie is that even though there is countless mistakes it is still number 3 on America's Film Instunte's Top 100 movies of all time. Fred Roos,Andrea Eastman, and Louis DiGiaimo did a fantastic job on casting Marlon Brando,Morgana King,James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Al Pachino, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and as well as countless others in casting for this movie.

This movie has really aged well . I'd watched it for the first time in 2010 ,38 years since it was filmed and i loved it . The movie has a lot of characters and it'll be hard to remember all of them so to get the real gist of the movie you have to rewatch a couple of time . But it's worth it . It's one of the best movies ever made in my opinion .
The Godfather is the one of the greatest films ever made. I've watch it so many times.
In case you want to start watching movies and you don't know the way to start you should start with this timeless masterpiece this movie is a masterpiece drawn very carefully from actors photography scenario audio, costumes scenes drama violence and emotion The great role of Marlene Brando in this movie makes you attached to this character and the principles that the role reflects You can't really describe this movie in the ways that I watched it Also I can't either, no matter how expressive words and balanced language I used to clarify the movie, I don't know how Francis Ford Coppol was able to turn the scenario of Coppola and Mario Pozo into this beautiful masterpiece.

It's ability to transcend the test of time, and it's perfect cinematic portrayal of an infamous subculture are what make this movie so highly regarded. The movie was so captivating and did such a good job of identifying the Italian American Organized Crime Sub-Culture that it actually became the handbook by which future generations of mobsters operated. I can't think of many movies that have had that kind of cultural impact. Brilliant production from start to finish! The show was cast perfectly helping to solidify it as a classic. Even today the movie is relevant and has provided a basis and format for movies about organized crime. Intensity of the scenes was key to the accurate portrayal of the life of a crime family.
In my opinion one of the best movies ever made, no waste from beginning to end.
I have watched all 3 parts of this series, all are amazing. I don't think i can watch any other movie(s) like that.
I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

Marlon Brando showtime, definitely watch outstanding performance.
..Barzini's a pimp. That is my favorite line in this movie...There are many more lines. Lines that everyone should watch. Because this movie is one of the best movies ever made, and certainly one of the best mob/crime movies. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, or anything else with Joe Pesci. You will like this movie just as much. The cinematic quality is fantastic. The dialogue and acting are very convincing and makes it feel like you are watching history, not just a movie. And speaking of history, talk about Marlon Brando. Good lord. The guy puts his existence on pause to breathe life into Don Vito Corleone as the Godfather. His roll is phenomenal.

And that's 10 lines, go watch the movie
I don't know how this movie is not #1 in top movies. Brilliant storyline, writing, top notch acting from each actor, unbelievable direction and surreal music. I don't think any film will ever come near this movie. This is the definition of perfection. If not for some stupid people in 2008 who don't have the slightest idea what movies are all about, this would've been still in #1.
First movie ever that catched me like no other one! That atmosphere is so thrilling and sharp, my nerves driven over! No words can describe this epic film. Must see. But only 1 an 2! Part 3 is not - in my opinion - The Godfather. Love
This is my first review. After watching Godfather,i started to see all gangster movies but no movies can match its quality.This is one of my all time favorite. Al Pacino's performance is mind blowing. When you're watching you feel like you're one of the members in the family. Marlon Brando's quiet and confident mafia boss character is impressive. The soundtrack of the movie is delightful. All characters are correctly fitting to the script and is developed beautifully. Francis Ford Coppola really made a good film out of Mario Puzo's novel. This movie stands at the top in all decades.

I highly recommend this movie to all movie fans. I rate it 10 out of 10
All time favorite movie. Acting is jabardast. Direction is Jabardast. Oscar award winning movie. I recommend to everyone to see the movie. Everyone justified their role. All the dramatic scene is perfect.
The effect it has on my "Godfather" is amazing, powerful sensation of tasting authentic cinema from the first to the last moment ...

Many talk about the wedding sequence is long and somewhat boring, and seems to me a presentation of characters extraordinary:

From Don Vito to Johnny are defined and characterized spectacularly, nothing squeaks, everything has a meaning, not a single actor out of tune, not a single frame is misguided ... in Ultimately, we are witnessing a starter that leaves you suspended in its history, its setting and in all conflicts presented in an absolutely impeccable.

The best movie of criminal organizations
The film the godfather is the film that rocked my childhood. I grew up with the replicas of marlon brando. My children are also addicted to the godfather trilogy.
Boring just boring , I mean how can this sheet get 9.2
The best movie of all time, because it shows what true character development is in a movie. The character arch of Michael Corleone through the movies is one of the best ever written. It succeeds not only in pulling off the use of a classical/formal/mannered film language correctly and remarkably; that language is used to emotionally evoke a grand archetypal American narrative, Operatic and Tragic, built around an immigrant family, and charting its rise, corruption, and fall in ways that comment on a vast array of subjects that relate to the American condition: Marriage, Politics, Poverty, Crime, Innocence Lost, Violence, Loyalty, Betrayal, etc. etc. So: It's a classical tale told nearly perfectly; with rich, soulful acting, magnificent cinematography, and insinuating, meaningful dialogue.
The worlds best movie. I simply love the story, the music, the acting, the casting, the filming, the dialog, the flow of the story line, the director, the editing. The audio commentary is also great fun. A 3 hour movie that feels much less. I have re-watched this movie 20 times and I'm far from done with it.
"The Godfather" Wonderful movie Reminiscent of the time of beautiful art




It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily.

This move touches on so many aspects of life from love, to death, to money to power. It really teaches you the value of all that i listed. Forever classic in my collections!
did i hate any thing about this movie ?? no did i like any thing ?? yes indeed and i like the music it was great like magic you will like the story ,, for shore it long long movie , but you will wish it is never end ,, what about acting ?? it was great ,, i really wanna know how they can do such a great movie like this in that time ,, and also i wanna know how can the writers can write story like that deep i wish i can watch it in cinema or something like this ,, but take my advice ,, watch it alone because it long movie and you do not wanna any one to cut it on you ,, and i wish you enjoy it and pleas give some Attention please you will like for shore ,, about me ??? i like so much believe me you will hear it over and over and over
Al-pacino had reach the highest level of actoring, and
This movie is such a masterpiece, an extremely best example for all cinema lovers and aspiring filmmakers. The cinematography is as best as today's generation movie. This movie is prove it self to a mile stone in the history of world cinema.

This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. its basically the story of the old generation of the mob being taking over by the new younger generation. great performances are done by all . the story telling is pretty well done all be it there are some slow downs where things seem they drag on a bit to long and gets a little dull. for the most part though its a entertaining story that will be watched for years to come .It's such amazingly well-acted, well- written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece.
This Movie is a work of art that is both past and contemporary. A family story. A tragic story. A piece of Italian American history. Beautiful and timeless.
My favourite scene is the horse scene, as for this film i will give it a 👍 to say the least
One of the best movies of all time! The acting. The directing. The production. The writing... just gets to you. I could never get tired of watching this movie! This movie makes you feel like you're part of that world. Francis Ford Coppola will always be considered one of the best auteur's in cinema! Al Pacino and especially Marlon Brando are superb! The score of the film is legendary. And, How Marlon Brando delivers his lines is just chilling of how amazing it is. I seriously, which that movies can be this good in our day and age! Movies are not like this anymore and movies these days are about franchise and blockbuster hits. Sad, how Hollywood thinks about money, it's show business, and key word "business." But, THE GODFATHER, is true cinema!
Best out of all 3, great to watch with friends or family or with your pet. like your cat or maybe your dog spot. well I dont know if his name is really spot or just a nickname. what was it we were talking about? oh yeah, the godfather, great movie.
Single film, engaging, holds the attention from start to finish. one of the trilogies best I've ever seen, second only to The Matrix and overcoming works like Mad Max. A classic noir film and recommended to all movie lovers on gangsters and the Mafia. The story is unique and the adaptation of the book was great. Quite unique, untouchable. A true masterpiece.

If you give less then 8, you must watch it again!!!
For me this is the best movie I have watch. 10 stars out of 10
Its one of the famous movies, its good, and it with al pacino and james caan. With famous quotes.

Although This movie is long (3 hours) it doesnt feel long.
The best film i have ever watched. an outstanding family portrait. Definitive film. 10 stars.
It's truly an experience to watch for the first time this movie. It's 3 hours long but still, I think I would still be captivated by the story even if it were 2 hours longer.

There's no break in the movie, and the necessary violence for a gangster movie is there, a lot!

Also, you can see the true talent of some actor. I think, without a doubt that it's the best Marlon Brando' movie ever. He's terrifying in that Godfather role and yet, you can see that he's a man that care entirely for his family and also that he's a man of conviction And we can those traits of character because Marlon Brando act it perfectly. Also, we can Al Pacino, but I still believe that he is better in the second Godfather.

To conclude, A truly masterpiece and I suggest everyone to see it once in their lifetime.
This is a Great Movie. I love how it tells the story of a family who is also head of a crime family.
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
Coppola's master piece, it is one of those "MUST WATCH" again and again!
It's extremely good and fantastic. It is a gangster film, or maybe an outstanding family portrait , every part conect together, really worth to see
Its my first time to write a review but i can say with confidence that The Godfather the best movie i have seen ever

I love this movie, this is on my list along with "Good Fellas" and "Scarface".
This movie is the best , if you don't see this you lost half of your life
I have seen the electricity many times and let people around me watch it several times. I'm glad to see this kind of movie. For some reasons, this movie will not be shown in China. Of course, he is older than me. However, it doesn't prevent me from seeing it and loving it.

Mike's steady personality gradually became similar to his father's, even more powerful than his father, and became the supporter of the family. Especially the arrangement of the plot and the contrast of the atmosphere make people admire it very much. Especially when Mike killed the director, the sound of the train was so immersive. My English is not very good, so writing comments is not very smooth. However, I like Al Pacino very much. I also like Godfather 2 as much as I like Quentin Tarantino. However, my favorite movie is undoubtedly Godfather in my heart.
Undoubtedly the best picture of all times and perhaps the only movie without a plot hole in the history of film making. Not a single scene or a line is unnecessary in the whole film. The direction, casting, plot, music, cinematography, acting, lines, everything seems just perfect. Al Paccino and Brando simply were born for their roles. But please don't bother to watch this epic film if you do like movies with extreme violence, sense less killing, unnecessary car chases and the hero fighting ten people at a time with bare hands. This film is totally in a different league, you simply cannot compare it to any other crime or gangster movie ever made. The way Al Paccino transformed himself from a subtle, educated and sophisticated Italian American into a typical Italian mafia boss, is without a doubt one of the best performances of all times.
One of the best movies I've watched. Must-see for those who have not watched.
The godfather is a perfect film, nothing lacks an excellent cinematography, masterful performances and a message never betrays the family.

The film was nominated by the Academy in eleven categories, and won three Oscars, for Best Film, Best Actor for Marlon Brando and Best Screenplay Adapted for Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. In addition, she was awarded five Golden Globes for Best Drama, Best Director, Screenplay, Soundtrack and Actor for Marlon Brando.
This movie is the best yet. I watched this movie over and over again. The Godfather is one of the oldest movies, I every watched. Godfather I, II, III, mobster movie are my best movie.
This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
It has the best elements from about every movie-genres. Some of the scenes are breath-taking. This was the first time I watched The Godfather even though I had the trilogy-box for months. My expectations was very high, so I've been waiting for the right time to watch. Today was the day. The Godfather overcame my expectations!! I will watch this movie one more time before moving to Part Two and Three. The Godfather need full attention. You can't watch a movie like this one on Saturday-evening with the kids running around the house and the wife vacuum'ing. This movie needs the right setting and you to be ready and in the right mood for one of the greatest movie-experiences. And I really mean it!! JG

One of the best movies of all times. Good plot, wonderful cast. In my opinion a piece of art.


i cannot understand how anyone enjoys this film.it is ridiculous,overacted,and the dialogue goes beyond description. i can safely state that it is the worst film i have ever seen.how has this rubbish become no1.the shawshank,yeah, a great film, but the godfather. i think that its one of those films that have become a trend.people who have watched it and hate it are scared to say so. the thing is awful.
N amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.


At first it was kind of boring as it got close to the end it for interesting
The asome movie whith the bes actors, i like the mafia movies, this movi is so amazing, you need to see the real mafia
I like this film, old but gold I like this film, old but gold I like this film, old but gold
Godfather of all gangster movies ever made. If you like valence movies, then this is the best movie ever made. The depth of the screenplay of this movie will make you feel a different world.
My all-time best movie. Excellent movie to watch, find time and enjoy
Loved every second of it. Deep and needs attention to understand it. Reason why i liked it so much.
Amazing movie it is use full and meaning full we can watch the movie and it is very spence
The Godfather is without doubt the greatest film ever written and produced. All credit to Mario Puzo, one must remember that the story was written back in the 70's, when so little was known about the Mafia. Coppolla has taken an absolute masterpiece and transformed it into an epic. This film has set a standard, that, in my opinion, has not been reached by another gangster movie since.

10/10
I would love to see a remake of this series sometime in the future.

I love this movie. You know, when there is sometime, nothing is going your way, life is miserable, sad and you cant sleep... just like what i used to.

By a chance, my friend introduced me this movie. Oh god, my best friend ever he is! The best movie ever this is! As I watch, no soon later i fall asleep! For days and months i didn't sleep well... Do you know how much this movie meant to me? Even sleeping pills didn't work for me.

After that, I watch this movie whenever i got frustrated and feeling sad. I always seeking for friends who got sleeping problem and solve their problem by introduce this, The Best Movie Ever When You Cant Sleep! It will work for you too!
It is an amazing movie love it
This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions
One of the best crafted gangster film ever. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. 10 stars out of 10.
The Godfather is the best movie of all time because it paved the way for cinema for decades and is incredible in its filmmaking craftsmanship.
A Classic...the best movie ever. Ranks #1 with me for all time great
It's one of the best movies I've ever watched, The cast, the story, the characters, the music, and the color pallets, everything was perfect, and felt so real. This movie will remain always, the best gangster piece in cinema history.
This movie has a nostalgic vibe to it but quite a classic despite the graphics.
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Beautiful crafted movie.
I still remember how it felt to watch it for the first time, all the elements in this films is made of artistic notalgia each phase of life when you rewatch it you will sense a different sensation, this film will always feel like coming home.
This is my best favorite movie. i saw this movie when i was a boy. I dont remember how many time i watch this movies
Godfather is one of the greatest movies of all time, it has all the ingredients of cult movie such as well weaved story telling, actors who have given the life to every dialogue, and yes the tremendous work done by the director.
John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.
This movie is probably the most overrated movies on IMDb, if not the most overrated. People on here are looking for too much out of movies and they aren't looking to judge them off of the right things. The movie was shot beautifully, the storyline is pretty interesting, but the movie is long, and dryly drags on and on. TO me the definition of a great movie is a movie that gets my different emotions running, whether it makes me laugh, cry, gets me excited etc. etc., this movie did nothing,I just sat there, I watched the movie, then I thought to myself, this movie is what people consider to be the best movie of all time. THe Best? H*** No, the best movie of all time should make my emotions run in everyway. I'm not saying its a bad movie, but its just not my idea of grade "A" entertainment. Definitely not number 1, before you bash me, just think about it.
Really enjoyed watching this movie, it is indeed on of the best movies I have seen. I heard so much about it but up until this moment got the chance to see it. Recommend it for everyone.
The best movie, i have ever seen. And a family movie.

This is actually super hit movie i really like to watch it multiple times.
Awesome movie recomend it to everyone because i think everyone needs to watch it. outstanding filmaking and i will watch it many more times for sure its that good
The Godfather is the pinaccle of flawless films!!! The screenplay, the direction and the acting makes this film flawless.

The Godfather must have at least 3 viewings to understand this film.

Such an amazing film highly recommend to everyone! its such a classic a must to watch


This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
One of the best movie in history in the god father all things is the best i saw a lot of mobster movies but the godfather is the best one
Vito sendiri telah memiliki 4 orang anak, yaitu Santino "Sonny" Corleone (James Caan), Federico "Fredo" Corleone (John Cazale), Michele "Michael" Corleone (Al Pacino) dan Constanzia "Connie" (Talia Shire) Corleone serta 1 anak angkat, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall).
This is the best movie I ever seen. I'm impressed with Michael Corleone, he's a good leader.
He is a good movie . But i dont see any reason why he is the first movie on imdb . He is good but not a legendary movie. Actually i think that peaky blinders is the best gangsters serie till now and i dont think that godfather is better than peaky . Marlon brandos acting is fine . But not as fine as cillian murphy . After all this is my personal opinion.
This should serve as an inspiration for upcoming generation actor. Dope characters. Really definitive
In September 5, 2018, was released the CGO live-action movie.

I love this move. The scene with the horse head is one of the strongest movie moments ever. I love the directing and the acting.
No movie will ever come close to Godfather 1 and 2. They are the pinnacle of Mafia/crime movies. New movies in the genre does its best to imitate what Godfather did, just look at "the irishman"...

Truely a must watch for any movie lover, and a real banger for anyone who enjoys a rich story.

However, it is a slow-burner, so maybe not for the action-lovers out there.

I really like this movie because i like the godfather name it makes me to watch this movie.The best movie i have ever seen I have seen only Godfather I but its amazing.The twist in the movie is the death of Godfather(father of Michel Corleone) while playing with his grandson Excellent Movie Gonna watch this movie again.... :)

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Great Film.
This film is very nice . The godfather is reality life and reality mind I think. It's a good artist and good write . A group of Turkish police called in to a desolate area stumble upon a squalid and blood-soaked den of satanic ritual... Baskin is a visceral trip into the darkest pits of a very palpable evil.A group of Turkish police called in to a desolate area stumble upon a squalid and blood-soaked den of satanic ritual...

Godfather, which is an adaption of a book by the same name, is one of the finest movies ever made. Both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and 1993, respectively. International critics routinely list these two among cinema's pinnacle achievements, sometimes considering them as one work. In the decennial 2002 Sight & Sound poll of film directors, the pair was ranked as the second best film of all time. Previous Mafia movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider. In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering.
Thank you Alpacino for this amazing performance You are the best actor ever
An Amazing and Timeless Movie where the artistry in each scene is superb, unique and full of Astonishing Talented Acting.
One of the best movies out there, deserves the ranking it has. An all time classic, can't go wrong with the Godfather.
No much needed to be said about this film except it is a definite must watch.
Well written classic must watch movie!!! Go see it or buy it!
One of the greatest movie i've ever seen if not the best. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando at their best. I can say that the first time i saw this movie, i taught it was the best experience of my life. The Godfather Part Two was equally as good as the first and The Godfather Part Three was good also but not quite at the first two. I heard many critics saying that The Part Three ruined the Trilogy but i don't agree, i liked it very much. I would give it 9.5 and 10 for the first two. The direction,picture, story, cast, acting all are perfect and that's why this film deserves the maximum grade. For all those who have not yet seen it, i strongly recommend to see it as soon as possible!
This is the best gangster movie I have ever seen. Acting, Story, Action all things are amazing.
I love the 2nd Godfather the writer of of this movie is in he/her time zone
This film captures the realness of the times it was set in. The acting is fantastic and the scenery general. The characters in the production have to each tap into sides that is not natural to them and made the film what it was by taking on the characters to the point where it seems like they lived through them.
God enough. This movie is god movie pls watch and comment.
One of the best movie ever made! Very good story, good actors and what a movie!
A masterpiece that will never had any other film to be compared with truth be told!
The best movie of all time Jebhdieoiecudioe diodbekxjeopwoendbsheiejnendkdoenenejekkekdkrnenene
I think this film is one of the best films ever made and better than most gangster, mafia films which are published in 2010s, and of course of all time. Some people say it is so long and boring but i don't agree with them. I think this one is more non-boring than most 3 hours films. Also it has a so good cinematography that you can call this film an "art". Also the dialogues and acting is so good. To sum up, this film is a must-watch masterpiece about mafias and gangsters.

Best movie film of all time a must watch ,!!!!!!!!
Despite having such a score, it is still underrated. For the new generation it can be a little slow moving movie. But with every scene it will take your mind away from you and u will say "Why haven't I watched this before?" as I said once.
This is definetely the best film af all times and Marlon Brondo's appearance is the acting of the century! Al Pacino is also great. The supporting roles (R. Duvall, J.Kaan, T. Shire) give also great performances. 10 out of 10
Godfather is the movie of the century and as far as i know it will stay at the top of the movie in another 5 to 10 century's.Since today I haven't seen a movie like Godfather. The story is too tragedy and it keeps you on watching the movie. The story takes you in the movie. They planning is too good! I have seen most of the mafia, police, tragedy and all of the same sort but in my opinion if you compare them to godfather, the highest will get 6/10 while Godfather gets 10/10. The main character of the movie "Don Vito Corleone" looks and act like a proper don. His personality and the way he talks is my favorite. Trust me when you watch the movie remember to notice how he talks and how he plans things. Hes a real G.
Crime genre movie with excellent cast and outstanding direction which makes me watch the movie again and again...won 3 academy award...based on the novel of Mario Puzo.. though the movie revolves around mafia family but not for those who are looking for a family drama..

This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable..
One of the finest movie I have ever seen. I love all the chartectors and there presentation. Cinematography is too good.

The Godfather is one of the most iconic films to ever hit the screens. It is a film that teaches you all the possible lessons in life, having at the same time such a powerful and emotional background story.I have never felt such strong emotions from watching a film before as I did when I saw The Godfather, it takes you in it's world and grasps you by the neck, indulging you in a story that you forever wished you could be a part of yourself. The Godfather is what the true mafia is about, Francis Ford Coppola takes the term "mafia" and really put's it into context by showing us nearly every possible situation involved within the mafia and how it has it's affects on family and friends. To conclude, The Godfather in my opinion is the best film of all time and if you haven't yet seen it for some strange reason then please go and watch it, you will not be disappointed.
I am Italian and i love movies. This movie creates a standard in which all movies should be based by. Awesome character depth, and their chemistry is perfect. Al Pacino gives an all time great performance and they should name the Oscar after him. thats right call it Al Pacino, cause Oscar is a stupid name. i love this movie and i think everyone should sit down and enjoy in at least once in their life. this is a great movie...white power. This movie is mafangool, which is Italian for bacon. No charcoal brickets should be able to see this movie. Moulians are to dumb to understand anything Italian's do. I give this movie a ten because i love it. I love sitting down and eating popcorn and watching this movie. I even like eating twizlers as well, cause they are juicy and tasty. They remind me of lips and i like to suck on them. I love movies so much and thank god for them.
For the classical mafia movie fan it is a must see. I still have the physical copies myself of the trilogy.

Yes this movie is so great. This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
Godfather is some of the best movies ever made,I havent to say any bad about this title movie like that cannon made again this is one in milion masterpice.
A very strong movie, brilliant actors as incredibly good script, and over the top directing.
I really like this movie and have seen it many times, even in 2020.
This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles.

I watch this movies all the parts... No doubt .. if you like to watch underworld movie.. this one will be your first choice to watch.. i really like all the parts of this Godfather. amazing work by all the stars. first and second part of this movie is my favorite.
Perfect acting Al Pacino.Professional casts. Thank You
I love this movie, specially those are on 70s and 80s. I just love to go back on Analogue. Lets love films for mankind.

One of the most favorite movie in my life i watched more times.
One of the best movies eveeeeer made! I see this film 5 time, I can see it another 10 times. :)
What can you say? Its a flawless film. This here is a pinnacle of crime films the cinematic lighting. The acting which is top notch, and that ending. I mean it has so much impact that it's impact is still in effect when I see it being parodied in other media.
Is vere cool this serie i am very happy to selected this tittle
Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.Massive bullshit about Italian mafia, family etc. Actors are great but you cant say the same about the screenplay and the hole idea of the film is not positive for the young.
I recently watched The God Father for the second time, the first time was during my childhood and the last time was after working for more than a decade in the filmmaking industry. I can strongly say that I am impressed with its tone, storyline and actors performance. I was astonished when I knew that it's the first acting experience for Al Pacino on screen adding to this the quiet outstanding performance for Marlon Brando. You can easily fall in love with the characters although you know they are killers and drug dealers. The family aspect in the characters are so real and genuine.

Despite it's a slow based story but you can't leave the screen or get your eyes out of it.
A real masterpiece; beautiful shots, great story and a good cast.
I have watched almost all the mafia movies, but this one is.... Not explainable, you have to watch it before you die
Everything is great! I don't know how to describe this movie. One thing for sure that this movie is aging like a fine wine. Someday in the future you watch this one more time and you won't be dissapointed, truly a masterpiece from Coppola.
Outstanding family portrait .this movie is a piece of art 100% i recommand
What a Movie. Suspense, Story Everthing is amazing
Cool is good to see i recomed it, but king lion is so good so you have to see it too
For me everyone should watch this one time in your life and you never regret. This movie has everything in a good movie. I dont want to talk about information of this movie because i dont want to spoil. That all i want to say. Just watch this OKAY.
A latecomer to this classic. An iconic film. 9/10.
simply put it's the best movie of all-time and nothing else comes close.... it shows the power of the mafia and aslo the ruthlessness and the hurt that goes along with being in the mob....its a true italian movie and anyone who does not see this movie doesnt know good film making....

Very nice movie, i love it and will like to be updated when there is more movie by the artist.
It is old, still it has its distinctive aristocratic effulgence!
I love this movie and I recommend it to everyone. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, "The Godfather" is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless.
Its good movie because of Marlon Brando.... And this is one of the favorite movie in list rank is 1st.
From the beginning the addiction of watching movie I ever found this, one of the best movie.
Love it amazing .. a must watch .. I've watched it like 10000 times
This movie is amazing. I can not believe this. this movie is absoultirly awesome.
Often advertised to me as the perfect movie, the best movie I'll ever see, and/or the be-all-end-all to movie-dom. It is a damn good movie. There's a reason Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan are household names. This movie is chock full of stellar performances, beautiful shots, and a compelling family saga. If it is too long (it is), a little slow in places (it is) and somewhat hard to follow in certain places (yep) we can forgive it, because they just don't make movies like this anymore. It isn't perfect, but it is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor, and let yourself be carried along with the current of this slow-moving, but powerful, bit of culture.
Love this movie! A true classic, never gets old. It was even better seeing it on the big Screen!
Such a great and amazing movie, God Father a marvelloues movie with a great screenplay and also a great cast.
Amazing In the same manner, the movie editors effectively and efficiently refined the film quality output by choosing the appropriate props for each film scene. The editor was very proficient in ensuring that the costumes of the movie actors were very realistic when they avoided creating scenes that depicted the unprofessional imitations of the 1940s New York mafia crime era.

Graeat. this film is clasical. very good. you can see the cuture of good father and all he have for the go to the top of money and power
Very well written screenplay and one of the best cinematography
The Godfather is an evergreen movie that can be watched anywhere and anytime.
Awesome experience watching this movie. must watch films for the people who like suspense genre. all the actors made justice to their characters. with all available resources that time (1972), the films technical properties are up to the mark.
MAN IVE BEEN LOKING FOR THIS MOVIE. I WAS WATCHING ON DAYTIME TV BUT THEN THEY STOPPED AIRING. IM GOING TO LOVE CATCHING UP
No words can define this movie it's100/10 and i still think this rating is way less and who am I to rate this movie.

One of the best movie gangster movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone. If you are a die hard fan of gangster movies you will definitely going to love this.
I truly Like It!! It is one of my favourite one!! Beautifully scripted
Have a certain understanding of Italian customs and mafia
This movie was amazing. I watched this movie several times a day and night. In fact, it was very exciting
The Godfather is a great movie with some iconic moments and delivery that will always be remembered globally
Good story that border on realism. Can watch but a bit boring for those who wants more actions but again this is not an action movie. Enjoy!
The title says it all, this is an absolute masterpiece of a movie, everything about it is perfect. To this day I cannot believe how could the filmmakers achieve the level of excellence that is present through out this whole film, from the camerawork, the performances, the sound mixing and of course the story telling it self as a whole. I can watch this movie anytime, it still provides the same amazement and fulfilment it did the first time.


Likes this movie, so i hope you can make movie slipt it
I initially watched this trilogy in a VHS collectors edition that was in time order so most the Godfather 2 came first with De Niro. I loved it then back in the 90's then watched it multiple times as in cinematic release order.

Having just reviewed this on our show we both loved it a true cinematic experience that still stands up to this day. Fantastic

Its a master piece! a must watch and highly recommencement to any fan of film.
This is the best movie about mafia ever. I think this movie is still better then narcos
This movie is true art and never get s okd. Perfect illustartion of the Italian underworld in the states with great actors, legendary conversations and good action scenes. On top of that great sountrack.
The godfather really shows the image of the Italian mafia, especially the music and characterization
This isn't fair a delightfully created hoodlum film. Or an exceptional family representation, for that matter. An astounding period piece. A character think about. A lesson in filmmaking and an motivation to eras of on-screen characters, chiefs, screenwriters and makers. For me, this can be more: this can be the authoritative film. 10 stars out of 10.
I like This Movie Very Much GodFather I think its seasons should release Now in 2020 lOL
It's a great classic. I was small when the movie premiered. I was able to watch it 10 years later and I don't regret it. It's a great experience. I looked at all the parts and I can recommend it to anyone.

It was very interesting. I love this genre of movies.
The godfather is the most well done movies ever , it shows how the people of the side we dont know about live their lives and how to deal with the huge problems that the may face during their lives, the film well made the sounds ,effects , footage all are amazing !
Must watch ! best cast and movie - all times favorite beautyboss
It´s perfect ! good script, casting, acting! It´s perfect ! good script, casting, acting! It´s perfect ! good script, casting, acting!
This is the film who taught me so much about the realism of acting on camera.whenever I watch This film. It's always feels like first time only. All the aspiring actors must watch this movie if you want to learn something really priceless in your acting career.
The best movie made. A masterpiece in cinema. Where art begins, it continues and reaches its peak. And this is not possible except with the best director, actors, music, costume design and ...
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10. Love it really love

A must watch classic. Amazing character development. Legendary soundtrack. This movie can only receive 10/10. Everyone who loves watching movies, I recommend this movie to them.
Very good.

My first and last review.

Boom boom need more characters.
The movie delivers from scene one. Looking into the compelling underbelly of the criminal world know as the Mob, it shows the growth of an empire. The Holy Grail of Gangster Movies upon which all others are compared.
Godfather is truly an iconic movie and one of Marlon Brando's most epic performances as an Actor. This movie represents, what it's like to be truly involved in the Italian Mafia, traditional family values, loyalty and most importantly to honor your word. Regardless of the years that go by, the Godfather will always remain as one of those movies, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Very good movie, TONY MONTANA MF4ERS ratatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatata
Best movie ever, watched many times but still it is the best movie watched ever

One of best movie i have ever watched. I didn't see any movie theme like god father present days
Best gangster Movie ever.. One of the best movie of all time. really love his acting.
One of the best of all time. The Godfather brings suspense, deep characters and a great plot.
Most beautiful movie in my watchlist. Everybody should watch this.
The great movie i have ever seen. Al Pacino acting was great.
This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
I don't think any other film can beat God father in any aspect,
This is one of the most valuable pieces of content available for creators to learn storytelling. Featuring a superb plot, screenplay, and dialogue, the movie delivers 100% entertainment to viewers.
This movie has strong script, excellent acting, great directing.
Love it for all types of reason. it feel like you are actually in the scene.
The Godfather is a complicated film, with a really intricate storyline. And it never stops, or slows itself for explanations. This movie just trust that the person watching is smart enough to understand all the non verbal cues. And you see yourself so emocionally invested in the characters and the story itself... It's brilliant.
The godfather to me is the most intricately made, neo-realistic film ever. It is the singular film that inspired me to become a film maker. Everything about the movie, from the plot, score, lighting, cinematography and neo-realistic nature appeals to that part of me that craves for expression via film making. I particularly adore the way don corleone was lit throughout the movie. I also got the opportunity to see the behind the scenes footage shot by a fresh out of college guy and it gave me more insight into the thinking behind the final project. Finally, for a seemingly low budget movie; when the budget is compared to some other movies made in the same era, i must say it's a winner any day, anytime. Every time i conceive a new score or soundtrack for any of my movie projects, I always hear the soundtrack of the godfather i my head.
Godfather it the best movie i ever seen and my favourite character is Micheel.

Piece of Art!!! Simply amazing movie , every person needs to see this, it teaches you many things in life, gives you inteligence and experience the movie like you've been there and came across all of those !! simply breath taking!
It's the 1st out of 3 movies. If you ask me, you must watch all of them. As a gangster moive, and appart from this genre, it is one of the best movies I have ever watched.
Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as an insightful, tough elderly person, really has the character lead in the film; Al Pacino, with a splendidly evolved presentation as Michael, is the lead. In any case, Brando's exhibition is a dexterous expendable, despite the fact that it earned him an Academy Award for best entertainer.
As per my exprience this movie is very nice. hope u r like it !
The best movie ever made in my opinion, a pure classic with legendary actors in it! Must watch if you haven't.
Nice movie to watch, you guys have to watch this, its a great movie. you guys will really enjoyed this movie like me.. belive me, you need to watch this.
Xem di xem lai den hon 10 nam roi ma bo phim nay van cu cuon hut su tap trung phim nhu ngay dau moi xem. Good film
If this is on the TV I am always compelled to watch this. Amazing cast and characters. It's one of those films that just catches you and you have to watch the whole movie again. One of the greatest.
If you haven't watched it yet, go and watch it now.
Still one of the best movies to date, one of my favorite. At this point I can't count how many times I watched this. I'm going to watch this over and over forever lol. Just does not get old. I consider this a time piece.

This a movie which every Actor should watch. Performance, acting, direction, cinematography. Everyone please watch this movie at least once, theatre, drama, action.. everything is there. Bad as performance, creator and wonderfully made this movie at that time when movie is making. The family story line is awesome, and the acting of the protagonist was excellently perform by the actor, specially the child of the father, but this film is not about father and son or father and daughter but this is purely about actors life, kindly watch this movie and the underworld reality, the film set and cinematography and every actor performs wonderfully.
A must watch for all category people. Great start cast with heavy loads of great acting of each and every character.
I believe that anyone standing in a high or low position in society should watch this film. It reflects many aspects and carries many different meanings, especially the way of living and treating people with each other.
There's no need to praise this movie anymore than it has been. Instead, I'd like to bring attention to the relevance it has to the crime genre. When we think of the 'tropes' of the organized crime genre in cinema, a lot of writers and directors pull from this movie franchise. I've even come across the tropes in the Godfather in foreign movies and series about organized crime.

I'd say without a doubt it is the Founding Father of the Genre.
This is a great film. And it is also the most over-hyped film of all time. I enjoyed the script and the acting. A little slow in some spots, and it failed to grab my attention emotionally. But it was a good 8/10.
I REALLY LIKE IT SO MUCH. ITS JUST BEAUTIFULLY ACTING AND STORY. GODFATHER REALLY GIMME SUCH A GOOSBUMPS WHILE YOU GUYS WATCHING IT!
Hands down the best movie ever. This will always be a classic
Masterpiece Brilliant acting Great storytelling Inspiration to all generations
It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
Not the best movie i ever seem but in My top 3 this movie dosent have a Hero or epic sence or...... Its just Show us Family life. Family matters (and some curismatic Character) and thats What i like abuot of this movie. I just can say. it was GREAT
Good movie but it is long , I mean 3 hours it is really a long time , the acting was the best thing and really great , the soundtrack not that good I don't now may be because I don't love classic movies
This film is a masterpiece from a cinematic point of view!
I just love this movie although the its bit slow. Every character in the movie were so real. You MUST watch it at least once.
This film is 49 years old. But you watched this film and you 1% not regretted beeelieve it.

Let me tell you first and foremost that I have viewed plenty mafia movies, not to mention I own several as well. The first thing I have to say about the Godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab, its almost as the Director is trying to make Americans fall in love with criminals,not to mention a bad display of Italian Americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as Goodfellas. The question we must ask ourselves is"Are Italians really that thick headed and vulgar?" and the answer is a resounding no. You almost get the impression that Vito Corleone is a homosexual and that James Canns Character has a mental diffieciency. The only good character depicted in the movie was Al Pacinos part. A man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond me.The only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which I thank Francis for
This Content is Nice This Content is Nice This Content is Nice This Content is Nice This Content is Nice This Content is Nice

I like the screen play of that movie it is just not a movie it is the best play ever I watch any movie before with this type of screen play

Awesome movie i love this movie.. i like this types movies a lot
The best movie ever !!! Actors,music and everything amazing !
Everyone does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
Absolute cinematic masterpiece!

From the sharp lighting to the heavily stylized acting. This is pure genius.
The Godfather is not a perfect film. It is similar to the original Star Wars in that while it's flawed, its originality and cultural impact cannot be overlooked.

This film creates a dark and realistic atmosphere that lays the frame for a story filled with love, betrayal, and plenty of twists along the way. While the slower pace and dialogue-driven plot isn't for everyone, those who have the patience and attention to detail will not be disappointed.
One of the best movie's of all time!!!! Great cast.
I really love this movie! This is superb! Director Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place.
Great movie for people growing up in the hood. I love it.
One of the best gangster film i see! Watch this movie, it's an offer you can't refuse !
In my view, this is not a gangster of crime inspiration film. I like this film about acting and cinematography. Brilliant work by actors and director. I think this film has the capacity for new generation moviemakers.
Great movie ,I like the making ,story awesome movie , I recommend must watch movie
The Godfather is the best movie I ever saw. No movie in my entire life has made me actually live the life of the gangsters when I was watching it . I wanna thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola and most of all the Corleone Family for giving me the opportunity to see this amazing work of art . I recommend this movie to all people..... and I hope it stays in top a million years from now. Once you saw it you will want to see it again , and again , and again because no other movie gives you that feeling of "I'm on top of the world" . The actors.... what can I say... you already know that one of the best actors in the world are playing , with the master Marlon Brando ahead of all. All actors who play'd in this movie had a fulminating career in the next years.

Watch this movie , and vote it 10 because it really is the best... if not for me do it for the memory of Marlon Brando.
This movie is the one of my favourite movies ,which the film shows to audience that how can be managed autority in family.Particularly, All of them played their role extraordinary.
Esta película muestra claramente el valor de la lealtad aun en tiempos difíciles y lo importante que puede ser la familia .
Very very well movie.

And very conceptual and beautiful film.
I think this movie is better than every other movie put together. Absolutely perfect. I won't go on why because I see everyone else already stated why this movie is amazing. Easily the best movie ever. If you don't like this movie you don't like movies, period. The music, acting, directing, dialog are all fantastic. The only other movie that can match this is PART II. With is the second best movie ever. This movie will live forever in the minds and hearts of every movie lover around the world. I can;t see how anyone can call this moving boring, actually this first time I watched it I thought it was just okay, but by the third time I was blown away. If you haven't seen this film go NOW and watch it, and then watch it again and again. It will the best movie experience of you life, I promise you that.
This movie is a masterpiece. definitely would recommend this to anyone.
A big classic, part of the canon! The Godfather is the reference gangster/mafia film of all time!
Great film that has shaped modern cinema and placed Italian immigrants in America on the map!
I don't want to say anithing. This is one of the 100 best films ever, and the best mafia movie ever. That's it.
I think is an amazing movie with great characters and a unique music.
"The Godfather" is to my generation (those born in the 1950's) what "Dr. Stranglove" is to those born in the 1940's and what "From Here To Eternity" is to my parents generation (those born in the 1930's) or what "Gone With The Wind" was to those born in the 1920's. They are all four considered the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME by their generation!(They are all four historical dramas with plenty of realistic violence, insanity,love, hate, sex & bad language.) By the same logic there must be a "greatest movie of all time" to those born in the 1970's as well as those born in the 1980's. That would be an interesting list, what each generation considered the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME? What did people born in the 1910's consider the greatest movie of all time?
I think this is great movie even though I haven't watch it (in my watch list)
In my eyes, the fact that a film with such fame and reputation should have a very good atmosphere, the feeling and taste it leaves, it can pass us as 'Goodfellas', 'Once Upon a Time in America' does not make this movie different from them.
It is an absolute honor to review this movie, for which I discover my true love for cinema. With powerful casting and great direction this movie will fulfil every aspect of true cinema. As like its title, this movie is a godfather to others.

This is a piece of art. For me it is after The Shawshank Redemption the best movie of alltime. It's just incredible story telling. You never get bored and it's even in 2022 still just factual a good mafia movie. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are playing magnificent. The music in connection with the movie is just perfect. The whole part in Sicily is realistic and well done. I love that all the people speak italian there. The film is a brand new thing on his own. After the moral code is broken. The whole storyline his full of small side storys. Every side story is good on his own. I just watch this film again every year and it's never boring.
Every time I watched this movie, you will truly understand what does "timeless classic" means. As a film maker, I truly admire this movie, and admiring the passion of early film makers are bringing to this industry. I do hope that more and more film makers will raise to the task and make something as great as this film.

The Godfather is a great piece of American cinema. It shows the rise of Michael into the position of Godfather. The story is told with great acting, cinematography and music. SHould be on everyone's to watch list.

Al Pacino is great as Michael and he acting abilities really shines in this one. He definitely showed us that he would be one of the greatest actors of his generation. Al teamed up with Marlon Brando, a great from his generation, Cinematic heaven.

It was a great start to the trilogy and an even better start to Mr. Coppola's career.
This is my favorite movie because of only creative shoot.
Master pace, it's best movie you can see, the directing by coppola was pefectttttt Literally, I did not feel the duration of the film and the acting was in the greatest aspect and the writing is the least that is said about it is great and I do not need to talk about the dialogues because it is the essence of this film and I can make my statement that it is the greatest series of films that you can watch
I was 25 when I watch Godfather Part 1 and it was crazy night. I think it is a wonderful experience ever. This is the only movie which I have watched many times. I was inspired by the role of "The Godfather". But unfortunately the 2nd part isn't very good as the first (in my opinion).
The film is undoubtedly one of the best films in cinema history as the father of the main reasons I think this is a wonderful director Coppola and unique game Marlow Brando and simplicity of the film. One of the best scenes in the movie The Godfather Death. The Godfather II and III as well as the integral of a good father of Fyml the number two and three are transferred. The only weakness of the film is that like a lot of movies and high-axis is the axis of indirect sex is not a crime. With Lpachynv The film also good but I think it adds a major reason for the continued presence of the father.Marlo Brando and AL pa chino is the best actor this film . in the end this film is very nice and in before died must watch .
This is best movies ever in the world and i never to forget this movies till i die.
What a great movie all the time !! already watch 3 times lol
I think nothing more to write about 'Godfather', people have already written a tons of reviews and articles on this cult movie. I think the movie like Godfather is once in a century. All characters and storyline with the best camera work are the milestone and placed in the syllabus of movie making.

The best..best and the best!
If you didn't watch until now, then watch it. It worths every second.
Still never gets old, a perfect movie. Everything about this film works on every level

Definitely my favourite movie, great acting a use of colours.
No words.. Just the best movie ever.

this is my favorite movie ever, i love all the characters, and the scenes. the songs in the movie transform all the history.

I give 5 STARS
The god father is the best movie in the world.this film shows the mafia in the best possible way
The movie is godfather looong movie the imagine indirectorof photography is good but acting is wel all actor
It's the best trilogy ever made, considering the time. Very complex and with an outstanding soundtrack and performances.
This is one of the best movies made till date. At the beginning it may seem boring and long but if you continue the plot, you will love it. Everything is good in it. This is one of the movies everyone must watch before they die.

One of the best Acting and Screen Play.

I would like give 10 rating to this particular film, because have never seen a dedicated actor like him, when we talk about the story this film, definetly this is one of the best film.

Highly recommended

Regards Karan.
One of the greatest movies ever. Pacino ,Brando, a must see and multiple times.
Amazing movies i ever seen.

I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! I have always loved movies on mafia and underworld. This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry! Oh my God.
A Film for all time. Music for all time. I can watch this film so many times again and still it is like I watch it first time.
A true masterpiece, the best movie of all time. The acting by Brando, Capino, etc are outstanding. There is not a single movie out there as good as The Godfather, period.

I love this movie, it is one of the best to ever watch. I would highly recommend. The title itself is attractive "The Godfather". Since it was released in 1972 it makes it one of the most notable movie in the history...
There are many more things that I should talk about this movie but I'll cut short. Cinematography, realism, script, emotions, actings, musics and so many other things make this movie Greatest. And there's an important point. All of these was made in 1972. Can you believe it? It's like invent a flying car. For those years circumstances, this movie is beyond masterpiece.



One of the best movies ever. Best Actor, very good production team and photography.

Recommend for best viewing.
This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
The Godfather sets the standard for contemporary filming. {Francis Ford Coppala} (Finians Rainbow) inspires George Lukas, Steven Spielberg and becomes the today's Orsen Welles. Godfather had extreme controversy during production and release mostly from the Italian community. (wanting to be presented in a good light and shed the mafia mentality) Francis breaks new ground in establishing the money is no object in creativity. Of note, Godfather is the last produced to have been printed in true, three strip Technicolor, as the plant in Hollywood ceased the process. Shooting on location, cast of prominent names and of course the Godfather himself, Mr. Marlon Brando. Godfather, a film to be viewed again and again, play's itself. The influence to go on to create the part 2 and part 3 series.

One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
This movie is absolute perfection, and now that it is out on DVD, it is something that must be owned. If you haven't seen it then make it a point to do so. It is amazing that this movie was made in just 62 days. The acting in this is fantastic, and worthy of the highest praise, this movie can be nothing less than a 10.

The GODFATHER the Best Movie Ever I Have Seen. I Have watched this 5 Times but Love to
I really love the theme of the mafia and have probably reviewed most of the films on this topic and this film is the best for me! It is the first part that all this atmosphere is simply unmatched! I really love this movie

An awesome movie if you like italian mafia kind movies.

Super cinema movie this movie show you the life meaning and family and also crimes life.
This is a movie that went down in history as a classic. I think that one of the problems that period cinema has is to overcome time and stay current in a decade where the cinema bombards us with shocking images created by computer. The films that survive despite not having these resources are masterpieces and The Godfather is undoubtedly one of these masterpieces of cinema.
"The Godfather" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

Loved the plot and the actors in this movie. They put a good cast together for this film as well.
I like this movie very much, it is made in a very good way, I don't think it is a movie, I think I am watching the story of a living person.
Not really bad, i really enjoy to watch this movie. But its really old and classic.
its a bad movie i don't know why you liked it i don't know whats am writing but its a good idea he how are you ? lets go out sometime why ? i like you good for you and you thank you yeah thank me and me no just me oh you are long lets see what can i say about this i really don't want to say anything why i don't know just wanna write a review cause am god at it no am not Ho's am kidding yeah am sorry and you should be i don't know why i say that a lot but its a good story and its a bad movie really bad i heat this movie and i heat you all i love myself and my mom dad yeah was a good times i agree with me and me just me yeah he is a bad person and a good movie no its bad really bad i heat it so much i love Friends and myself yeah Jahfali he is a good person
This film will always be a classic to me. Best acting and a quality production.
This is the best crime mafia movie ever and have the best punchlines as well.
A thrilling film that explores the Italian mafia and reveals its codes and rituals. Its rhythm, the lights, the omerta, the climate of tension contribute to plunge us into the heart of this microsome known only by initiates. Many scenes such as the assassination attempt of Vito Corleone and the aftermath are so striking that they remain engraved in us as "Do not tell me that you are innocent because it is an insult to my intelligence and it makes me in a bad mood." A pure timeless masterpiece to see and see again.
Much Entertainment Me. THIS MOVIES IS SO FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE . I know.
Amazing cinematography!

Really like this film, still watch until this day!
Hi, i am CEO from new brand company. Now i want starting Valuable info for working. I enjoy with your article, please keep itu happy writing!
Mohsen.r06 instagram godfather for all people al pacino is wonderful.
Very well crafted gangster film with an unexpected twist.
This its the movie that anyone ho love the mafia have to watch first than any other.
One of the best film ever. Actors play well. Directed very good a the time the amazing music, still one of the best sound we ever heared.

This Movie was amazing. I saw this movie many times.

This movie makes me cry. I fall in love with this movie.
Greatest Film all of the time.

Will be historical film, so the actor in this film sill a life?
The most beautiful movie you can watch is about a mafia boss, I can't remember how many times I watched it.


It was really fantastic. Great Marlon Brandon and Al Pachino.
I mean, I like Shawshank a lot, but I always thought The Godfather should be number 1 in any list of the greatest films, and lo and behold, I check back and now it is!

The two greatest performances in American film, a supporting cast that is light years ahead of the leading actors of today, and on and on. I've watched this movie on the order of 75-80 times, and every time I sink into it like a warm bath on a cold night. Anyone else anxiously awaiting the DVD release in October?

Those of you that don't get it...hey, how about a remake? About time!!! Let's see, we could get that Hunky Kevin Costner for the Vito role (he's old now, right?), Jim Carrey could be that wacky guy Sonny, I think that Jennifer Love Hewitt would be PERFECT for Kay, and for Michael, how about... Freddie Prinze, Jr.!!!!! Omigawd, it would be too kewl!!!!!!!
I loved the plot,characters, everything about it was amazing. This movie is very iconic!

The Godfather is One of the most great films in the world.
The Godfather (parts one and two) is as good as the book. Even if it is a tiny bit dated it is an amazing story!!

If you want to be a gangster then this is for you.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The godfather is one of the tops gangster, crime movies in the world, also best films of all time.
Marlon brandos acting was awesome Pacinos innocent face but cold mind was well written.

Sonny was well played Now why I give 9 stars The character development and backstory of luca brasi should've been included in the movie from the book.

Anyways the acting of brasi was awesome.

Brasi is my fav that's why i am a lil dissaponted but anyway the film is a masterpiece.

It was good enough to represent every character with a different style and best script I love all the characters. And all love the casting done by them.
Best film for us...I'm die hard fan. I saw too many times even with my grandfather oh my god it's amazing.
One word for this movie is "Masterpiece". You can see the best actors of industry at their peak . Liked that how story moves as Journey of Al Pacino from hating to belonging of Mafia Family to being the Boss itself at the time.



This film beautifully captures all aspects of real life mobster activity, while also telling the story of one mans decent into darkness. It somehow allows you to feel the internal struggles of each individual on screen no matter which unspeakable action they had just commited. This movie has stood the tests of time and is the perfect precursor into the next film.


So,basically,The Godfather is a classic of old generation. It is one of the best movies with the best screenplay. Honestly I wasn't thinking that I would like this film. So the first 30 min was kinda boring but then the movie went to its peeks. I really like thsi film a lot. One of the greatest movies ever........... The best characters of this film are Vito Corleone and Micahel Corleone. It was like Vito was the Man of the show and Michael is the man's Shadow. Characters were designed in a great way........ The Background Score was pretty gud too. Especially the music at the end was captivating and Impactful......
If you guys love gangsta movies this will surely be the best you ever watched.

Best of the best! You can't find anything like this.
It's a very creative movie based on a great novel it was beautiful all the acting, the directing it fully deserves to be the greatest of all time.
A fine example of what a great piece of storytelling and cinematography can be. Al Pacino is the center piece of the whole plot which revolves around Marlon Brandon.
Wow! One of the best crafted movies I've ever seen! The atmosphere is just taking you back in those crazy times.. Just speechless how much I liked this film.

All Time Favourite. Inspiring many other films, still the godfather always the king of somany films.
The Godfather is one of the best films for me. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
I love this movie and never get tired watching this movie.


Great Movie and I strongly recommend to anyone looking to have a good taste of ACTION and epic stories.
A complex movie to watch and, surely, difficult to have been produced.

Mythical scenes that will remain in the unconscious public collective like the beginning of Marlon Brando with a characterization for the unique and masterful character. A magnificent cast of actors for a unrepeatable cinematographic work! From start to finish: cinema masterpiece!
This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time. An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
A great movie ever made in cinematic universe!!!

If you are a lover of cinema then you should not miss this work in ever aspect i would say.
To be honest, if this movie isn't the best ever, it's at least one of the best I've ever seen. What a masterpiece ... I've watched it twenty times since I was a teenager. A must see for all fans of gansters movies!
Great Direction + Amazing Script. We want more movies like this.
The film is amazing and one of the favorite movie of all time.
This movie very good. It's a perfect masterpiece. This movie is probably one of the best works ever. Movies of this quality are rare now.
Simply the greatest movie of all time! It is a must see spectacle. Flawless acting and presentation, truly a masterpiece in every way possible. A film that must be seen by everyone!
It's without doubt the best movie ever made. The film's picture is incredible even though it was filmed in 1972.
The Godfather is still a very enjoyable and strong film, even after more than 30 years. Something that we can't say about a lot of other mafia movies. There is one scene though I find not convincing enough and a bit clumsy, and that is the first scene with Johnny Fontane and the godfather at the beginning of the movie. Now, taking under consideration that Coppola was under a lot of stress during the shooting, because he was threatened to be replaced, the scene doesn't really work as it should in such a flawless masterpiece. Not only do I miss more insight in the relationship of those two men, the camerawork is lost for a minute and I feel it has been build up too much as a set-up for the Woltz scene, which is a mistake.
You thinking why I am said The Godfather is amazing when You Show then you know why I am said the godfather is amazing.
Very nice for The GodFather I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.
One of the best mob films in history, everything about if just so wonderful. We've yet to have a film surpasses it in quality.
This movie change everything, it has great actors and good screenplay is the best movie ever. If you still don't see it you must to. But the only thing I found is this movie is for men more than women. Is a little violent so I think is why many women doesn't like it like men. I would like to tell that this movie is based in a book named The Good Father and the book is so much interested and the story is longer and complex that shows in the movie, still the movie is the best movie you can see. So I recommended to watch it is you still don't do it. And the soundtrack is the best Coppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including the main theme, "Speak Softly Love".
The movie so amazing to see man times. This is my one of my favourte movie of that time.
This movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting.

I don't remember when I first learned about the movie The Godfather, but it's impossible not to know it. Still - the greatest gangster tape, one of the films that turned the world cinema and left a mark on culture comparable to Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. The first time I tried to watch this film was in 2015. And I did not master it. I understood that there was a great and clever canvas in front of me, but I simply could not master it. For me, The Godfather was like a classical music concert: beautiful, but incomprehensible. But, after 5 years, having prepared, I decided to re-watch the film and now everything has changed. I really liked this film, but at the same time I do not like it because of the extremely bad message.
I was fortunate to see "The Godfather" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many "gangster" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about "family" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have "The Godfather" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a "gang family" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.
There is a class of hell to hold people who refuse the offer to see this movie.

,This film is by far the best film ever made, I, who do not get tired of watching it, its unique soundtrack and narrator of the ups and downs of human life, I learned many lessons for a better life and knowing people from the great Don Corlione I suggest you watch this movie.
It is very mesmerizing movie. It contains a lot of element like suspense,thriller action,drama and hell lot of things. This is the movie which people remembered to decades. I can surely say that this is bingo watch movie. The direction is mind blowing.on the safe side, i can surely say that this is the movie which utilize your time properly.

Best film ever its so amazing i have enjoyed every step and second in this movie God is great am one of those who did it.

Keep providing us the best stuff ever so so good to watch alot of teachings am keem fame i enjoyed the film so much.
This is a great offer and should be taken advantage of immediately.
Ugh it's so good. But can y'all help me with something? How the hell do i make a page for someone, do I have to make sure my profile checklist is done or..
This is a great movie. You won't be disappointed if you watch this movie.
Just a legendary movie with legendary actors.

The movie match so well with the book! Marlon Brando is a his best !
In the history of cinema The Godfather (1972) will be remembered as one of the best movie & all time favorite o movie lovers. Acting, Direction, Editing, Cinematography it has done well in every department.
The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie.


Nice. The best In the world The greatest series you will ever watch .
The Godfather is one of the best movie of all times, with it's style, structure, and playing characters it definitely leaves a mark in a memory.

The movie brings us to the times, where New York City was so criminal, and Italian Mafias were spreading across that region.

It is the superb movie, to watch if you would like to learn a lot about Italian culture, and how the Godfather - Don Carleone took care of his business, money, people, and criminal world, and who had, a good heart, at the end of the day. The scenes take place in both Italy and Little Italy, New York City, USA!

Thanks.
On of the most legendary films in the entire film history. I was a kid when I first wathced this masterpiece (probably, not the best movie for kids). However, it became one of those films which shaped my taste in films. BRAVO!
I love that movie and every GF movie. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The history of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people everywhere in the world. This film has been called an American story, however, I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. In many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
The best movie I have ever seen, I do not remember how many times I have watched.
Basically I thought that this movie was a piece of crap. In no way does Marlon Brando portray a decent mafioso. I'd rather watch Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. Speaking of how horrible this movie was, Al Pacino is probably the worst actor I've ever seen. Everyone talks about how great he was in Scarface. I mean I have to give him credit, he did go on to become a superstar with great films such as: Any Given Sunday, The Merchant of Venice, (and let's not forget) The Recruit. Talk about an amazing movie, add Colin Farrell and Al Pacino together and you'll get something Jesus couldn't even come up with. I mean seriously, how many times did they shoot Don Corleone and he was still alive? I just don't buy that. As an aspiring actor, If I would have read the script for The Godfather (part one, two, or three) I would have laughed and wiped my browneye with it. Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola for making a horrible movie. I recommend this movie to no one. If you are one of the millions who support this movie, I hope you burn for eternity. Check out Public Enemies if you want to see what a real Gangster movie is like.
One of the best movie I have ever watched. This is a significant change in Hollywood Industry. Must watch this movie before you die.

Wow, amazingly beautiful story that attract you to watch it all, even the smallest details are amazing, I think its become the icon for all movies till now. Al Pacino has that perfect act and I'm sure he will always be remembered by this name (Michael Corleone) also Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro (The Godfather II) will always by remembered as (Don Vito Corleone), all of them played the (Godfather) perfectly. Beautiful pictures, locations and the soundtrack that touch your feeling and you will never forget it. Thank you Francis Ford Coppola for this contribution that made the tragedy and drama movies worth to be watched, thank you Mario Puzo for this amazing story, thank you Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and all the cast for sharing your acting talent.
Great movie. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)


This is my favourite film. And after seeing al pacino 's acting i will definitely watch scarface too and the characters of this Godfather series was too good. I have seen that this this is on 2nd highest rating movie so i am here to give more rating to this masterpiece so i can help this to be on 1st highest rated movie on imdb.

Thank you.
Best movie ever created. Full of little details and action. Never gets boring even for a minute. THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.
I saw the film for the very time tonight and while I did enjoy it, I felt it was a bit overrated. There's been so much hype and deconstruction of this film over the last 4 decades, it's hard to approach it with a fresh perspective. Th cinematography was really beautiful and the lighting especially in the indoor scenes really set a glorious mood. I enjoyed the more subtle performances given by Diane Keaton and Al Pacino. A lot of the violence however, seemed gratuitous. The biggest flaw, frankly, was choosing Marlon Brando to play the Don. I love this actor and have enjoyed many of his performances, but this wasn't one of them. I thought he was dreadfully over-acting and ghoulish. It was a gross caricature and how he won "best actor" is a mystery to me! All the talk of how he had to "age" himself for the character made a mockery of his role with the Kleenex stuffed in his mouth and his put-on gangster voice was just distracting in the end.
I have watched this movie 25 times. No movie is better than this movie till now.
Whoever sees Godfather for the first time mesmerized the severity Likes film godfather will speak for days, maybe weeks for scenes of the movie and all that is deliberately movie will discover new moments ...

always i adore movies that witness many times and not once in a lifetime ... The Godfather of films that will be with you for the rest of your life.

I saw the movie and I'm 10 years and after more than 15 years and I see that I have a very beautiful childhood because it was moments of the film The Godfather contain.

Finally, I would like to add the names of the heroes of the film who have become giants in art and every artist of whom great art school.
All should watch this so powerful I watch this film a lot all actors are beautiful the crew were great too Beautiful shoot too
One of the best movie I ever see.

Godfather learned me a lot of things that I don't know before.

This movie always stay in my favourite list.

And also godfather has thousands viewers in iran and have a lot of fans in this country.
When i watched this movie for the 1st time i knew i will become a cinematographer someday. I had to watch over and over to get some things inside cus it was really a movie not to miss i scene or bling your eyes.

The God father teaches alot about the society and its people and how you need to trust people and also be aware of who we trust.
Though it's a movie of a gangster family's life. But it taught so many humanity and how to treat people good and bad. At first, I don't really want to watch this movie. Untill my girlfriend recommend it to me. I watch the first chapter and soon I addicted to the next Chapter. This is just kind of best movie. Love Italian so much.
It insists upon itself It insists upon itself It insists upon itself It insists upon itself
I have watched this classic more times than I can remember.

I love that everytime I watch, I discover something I might have missed before, or a scene that I might have forgotten. The late great Marlon Brando was such a polished and refined actor, and watching a very young Al Pacino is a treat in itself. I recommend for everyone to take some time to watch this movie!!
Great. I like this movie. I have watched this movie over and over again and still don't get bored watching it. The plot of the movie is very engaging. There are many unexpected and touching details.

I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed.

Authentic MASTERPIECE.

This is a greatest film i ever seen. This film tells the life of an extraordinary gangster. There is a little violence but the storyline is amazingly good.


3 hours and still captivating. The atmosphere is so very well designed. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
The Best Movies of all time. Story, Screenplay and Direction well crafted.
Best movie ever I like it more than the shawshank redemption. This movie should be number 1. The movie is based on a stephen king novel about a man sent to prison in 1949 and forming a friendship with a man there.
The Godfather Is Not Only Just a Movie . I mean Its such a Metamorphosis Based On the Novel By Mario Puzo . I rated it 9 Out of ten And I Think That Rating Worth It . Sir Francis Ford Coppola Done a very Good Job and this is Outstanding Man . Whenever I Used To Watched This Movie , I just Lost Myself In The Mafia World Full Of Terrorism and Thriller . And You Know I Never Felt Tired Of This Epic Masterpiece . Whenever I Watched This Movie , Its Still Agitated My Mind Like i was Watching For The First Time . You Know What , To Describe My Latent Feelings About This Movie , Just 1000 Words Wouldn't Be Enough For Me !! So I Better Stop Here .Last One Thing I Want To Say , The Godfather Is One Of My Most Favourite Movie As Well As The Book Of All Time . Every Single Person Should Watch This Epic Masterpiece Before They Die !!
This was the best movie I've ever seen. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the production and the game for giving me this beautiful feeling.
The Godfather and it's two successors are my favourite films,because the Mafia isn't only shown as a criminal organization but also a family affair full of emotions,force and weakness,like in the most lives.The playing of all actors is great,the music of Nino Rota provoke always strong feelings in me if I hear it.Also this music is a part of my favourite soundtrack.I saw the three films many many times and they gave me a understanding of Italian or sicilian mentality.I got a lot of sicilian friends and I surprise them always with my knowledge of their manner of living and thinking.I'm not a criminal guy,but I wish some- times we could have in Germany some Robin-Hood-like Godfathers of the special warm Corleone-kind. Because without them the really criminal and brutal subjects (in our special european case:Eastern Gangsters without a feeling for their victims) will win the play. Forget about protection by Police,the family would do it
The inspiration from the movie a sort line and sort story.

The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. ... Michael, the young and idealistic son of Vito Corleone, the head of the most powerful Mafia clan in New York, returns home as a war hero and is determined to live his own life.
For me.. This is the best movie ever.. A great story, super stars actors plus awesome acting.. It shows deep inside the world of Mafia in Italy and how it moves to New York (USA) early 1930th.. The way Don Vito rolled the Mafia (including all families) and how he was at one side killing and smuggling for the Mafia (Family) benefits, he was on the other side helping (Poor) people to have what they are looking for!! Don Michael is an excellent story too, the realistic man who was serving in US Army during WW2 1945, turned to be at the critical time to unify his family killing all enemies and keeping them all under his umbrella as a new Godfather! I strongly recommend watching this movie..
Probably the best movie of all time. Everything is so good that an almost perfect work has emerged. It is a movie that will shine like a star in the world of cinema for years. After this movie, no "mafia" movie has been better than this, and probably never will be.

The actors played their roles very well. Nino Rota has made excellent music. The costumes, locations, and camera angles combined with Coppola's great direction have created one of the best works of art in history. Although it has been a long time since the film was shot, it still stands in our memories as a masterpiece. Thanks, Paramount, and appreciation, Coppola.
Always been in love with the atmosphere of these movies! Perfection!
Many people have memories with this film. It is said that many of the action genre films that are being made today are actually inspired by this wonderful film.
The Godfather is a prime example of a film by a genius who tells a story through his own perceptions and knowledge that prevails to be one of the greatest films ever made..The unflappable tenacity of the man the Director Francis Ford Coppola to display his vision of a time that is seated now in the American mainstream an imprint of Americana, the look, feel and archetype of a time incredibly captured on 35 mm...I have gone back in time to see this great film several times and with each journey I take whilst watching the film I am taken through the story of a mans view of our world and a time once where cities were governed by a darker underbelly of ruthless street thugs posing as upstanding citizens and living by a credo of Family love and death and violence. These kind of epics with their bold performances and matchless chemistry reach the mainstream few times in a lifetime and remain such forever in both the annals of history and realm of entertainment


Highly recommend movie. A lot of action throughout the movie with a lot of it.To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. mafia and family life is superb in every department, writing, acting, directing, a highlight of Coppola's career as well as of New American Cinema.Vizzini was right: Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime.Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece.
The masterpiece can be awarded the greatest creation of the 70s. The movie which is the reflection of the mesmerizing collection of Mario Puzo's trilogy. It has aptly presented the Italian refugee community at that time fighting for their existence and identity in America and the real darkness of the 'Cosa Nostra'. Other than that it also shows what a man can do to protect his family. The desperate measure, the fearlessness and the bold characters can be truly inspiring. The ambience it creates cannot be expressed in words.
There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Pozzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.
The Movies Is a Masterpiece You Could Never Forget, Neither To Not to Be Impressed, The 1st Scene in The Godfather I Impressed Me, The Music Is Still Living With Me Until Today on Every Electronic Device, You Imagine The Family Is Dedicated to a Crime Syndications and Tycoons, But Its Totally About Family, Despite The Occupation of This Family,We'll Never Find a Family That Is Dedicated and Loyal to Each other Like that Family, Al Pacino Was The Reason For The Movie, With The Noble Reason for The Shifting of His Attitude..

I Have To Go To Work Now, I'll Finish The Other Part of the Comment Later...
The Godfather is a must see. Most of the movies today have taken some of the elements from The Godfather. This movie is well done, well told & well shown. I wish most movies today took the time to make sure the details are as noted in The Godfather.

The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime "family" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch "Don" Vito Corleone.
One of the great classic American films of the 20th century, The Godfather, directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based off of the novel of the same title by Mario Puzo is often considered to be the most influential film that created the 'organized crime' or mafia/gangster genre in cinemas.

Since its release in theaters in 1972, it has garnered a cult following among fans which led to 'The Godfather' becoming a trilogy with Parts Two and Three both released in following years.
One of the greatest movies of all time!! Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.
The scale of achievement is such that it not only defined the image of gangster culture in the popular consciousness but also influenced real gangsters and mafiosi to imitate the film's characters in style and manner of speech. Francis Ford Coppola admitted that he did very little actual research into the gangster culture and that to him the film was a stylistic "modern myth" about the Italian-American immigration experience.
Hands down one of my favorite films/story. The transformations of characters throughout the film is shown so well visually.
It's a must-watch movie. If you are a fan of cinema, you need to watch it.

At the start it can sounds over-hyped, but when you realise the hype is genuine you can see the beauty of this movie.

You can not die without watching it. Go now.
First of all, if you watch this movie and don't go ahead and watch The Godfather, Part II, you haven't seen the whole work. They are a single piece and are best experienced that way. (If you don't have the six hours to kill, at least view each movie on consecutive nights.)

Having said that, this is the story of Michael Corleone, a man whose need to protect his family at all costs ultimately destroys it. While Michael's father, Vito, often used violence as means to bring security and prosperity to his family, for him it was always "just business" -- nothing personal. Michael, on the other hand, proves unable to approach the dirty business of running a crime family with the same detachment. From the first murders he commits to the last, it's always personal with Michael. Because the violence is personalized, Michael is corrupted by it in ways his father never was.

I think it's about as close to Shakespearean tragedy as 20th century American culture ever came. Truly a compelling work of art.
Yes they do deserve an Oscar please.

I'd definitely recommend you to watch The Godfather I've learned so much strength couldn't explain enough to you'all.

Thanks to imdb for letting me sharing my experience here.

Stay humble and fight just like how hard they worked and boom here we go you guys are doing an amazing jobs.
It's a thick character-based plot line. Just because there's not an explosion every 3 minutes doesn't make a movie boring. It makes it a drama. It's a genre that doesn't generally feature giant explosions and shoot-outs, because the conversations are where the real action is happening. If you don't like that kind of movie, you're not going to like The Godfather. I seen this movie before but I use to think its was boring but now I become a little mature and give a chance again and now I know that I was wrong about this but I just sit and watch the whole movie and it was great. I even watched part 2 and part 3. The Story is great and Acting is great too. You need to sit down and watch this movie carefully but its not for everyone. So Far its one of the best movies I seen. Plus it got great actors like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall etc.

The Godfather shows that there is still life in the massive production engineering which made Hollywood studios the wonder of the entertainment world in their great days.
The godfather is without a doubt a fantastic film but the cringy Americans ruin it. A lot of people that claim it's the best film ever usually believe that because they are being told so and other people tell them so. Fantastic films but ruined by idiots.
I'm forgot how many time i watching this movie. The god father trilogy the best movie ever on 20st century.

Don Corleone make this movie so strong. He send the message for us if family is number one.
Its really hard to describe, but this movie is just wow. I would suggest everyone to watch it. Honestly i wish they still made moves like this, because this goes in the "unforgetable" category.
Awesome! A great movie that helps us to enjoy the old-fashioned styles along with war, mafia, drama. I am always a super fan of this genre and want to rewatch this movie so many times.
This is the most accurate mob movie of all time. Nothing even comes closer to the actual mob than this movie right here.
The reason why I value this movie so high, is because of the brilliant casting of its players. Especially the young and not yet well-known Al Pacino. The director Coppola insisted that Al Pacino would play Micheal while the production company wanted someone else. The great pressure on Al Pacino to proof himself as a worthy actor is perfectly seen during the entire movie. Its seems that Pacino has a lack of self confidence which fits the exactly the type of character he has to play. In The Godfather 3 you see an entire different Al Pacino. His qualities are already well known and thus there's no need to proof himself anymore.

Also the role played by Duvall as Hagen is beautiful and is really missed in the third part.
A sensational film in its conception. Fantastic history.
This film is very long but well worth watching. A story worth witnessing at least once. Thou fictional the Godfather is a film which captures the audiences imagination and will lead them into the verge of reality. As addictive as getting involved in conspiracy theories or the Da Vinci Code. This film could alter your life. Therefore to conclude. Againsts IMDb.com English only policy i say "molto buon". The Godfather is the first in a trilogy of films describing the life of Michael Corleone. Filled with an all star cast the films delivers on all aspects of filmography. Comedy, Romance, Action, Thriller etc. Admittably the comedy is limited by the ruthlessness of the Corleon families lust for power. The trilogy of films confirm that wealthy people can get away with murder, literally. Most touching about the film is the Italian mafia's resilience to touch drugs. In an effort to prevent any spoiler notes i'll try to end this comment hoping it is longer than 10 lines. A stupid rule set by the powers that be.
It's not a movie, it's a living manual as a family man.
Stereotypes have got to start somewhere. This is the birth of the modern gangster movie, so I'd expect the character types to be emulated by later films in the genre.

The first of the films I watched. I fell in love with the film for the atmosphere of the 50s: cars, clothes, people's behavior, music. In short, I couldn't help but fall in love with this movie. It's full of drama and unexpected twists. I won't spoil the plot for you. But I think that those who love the aesthetics of the 50s will not remain indifferent.


For me, this film is the standard of what a film should be in general. I never use superlative words, but here is the perfect direction, the perfect script, the perfect acting, the perfect music. Until now (and it's been 36 years), in my opinion, nothing has been shot in the genre of "gangster thriller", not only superior, but even close in quality. It's not a movie -it's life. You can watch it endlessly, and with each viewing discover some new details, circumstances, thoughts. At one time I watched it endlessly, in Russian and in English, and read the book, and in general I was a real fan, which almost never happens to me. Now I prefer films that are less bloody, but I take my hat off to the creator.

In general, what to say. Everyone has probably already watched it. And who hasn't watched yet - throw everything - and to the screen!


A truly legendary film, although some people (in particular Russian viewers) do not consider the film as such. But still, the fact remains, because in this work there is the subtlest psychology and philosophy that go beyond the film itself, unlike various modern works, where the whole ...

An important place in American history is occupied by a period when several thousand Sicilian immigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life in which there will be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxian Dons. Who knew at that time that this "pile of Sicilian emigrants" would take a high place in the United States and in the history of this country.

I watched the movie after reading the book a couple of times, so my viewing turned into another reading. Filmed very close to the text, and this once prevented me from enjoying the film itself to the fullest. I remember that as a child I took the book "Seventeen Moments of Spring" and compared it with the stems that they say in the film of the same name with Tikhonov. It turned out word for word and became uninteresting.

What is The Godfather for us today? We know that this is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema, for most people it is, in principle, the very embodiment of the word "cinema". This is the ideal of authorial dramatic cinema, which is close and understandable to a wide range of viewers. It is an integral part of popular culture, broken into quotes, images and memes.

Although this film has a three-act structure, all the acts are well packed with content. And so the film is watched in one breath. And most importantly, what message ... Each person has the right to decide for himself what meaning was laid down by the author. For me, the central theme of the story is the theme of the family and its importance. In three hours of screen time, the two protagonists undergo a gigantic evolution, turning into their opposites in interaction with each other. The all-powerful mafia becomes a feeble old man, and an idealistic young man becomes an unscrupulous killer.



It was strong! The legendary novel did not deceive my expectations. Heroes, events, reflections on the mafia in politics, in the state - all this became for me like a "thunderbolt" for young Michael, who was forced by circumstances to grow up quickly and understand the meaning of the family.

But it will be much later, and the novel begins when Vito Corleone is in the prime of his strength, power and influence on society.
The film really catches with its plot, well-chosen actors and their game, atmosphere, dialogues. The quality of shooting, I think, is quite a subjective moment. Personally, for example, I really liked it and I just can't imagine how it is going to be presented differently.
The godfather to me is the benchmark that I use to rate all movies that I watch. Its the very first movie that I can recall watching when I was younger.

No words can describe the depth and greatness of this iconic film.
First of all, The Godfather laid the foundation for what real movie gangsters should look like: respectable, but at the same time cruel people who only care about themselves, their family and their subordinates. This type, more or less, was followed by all subsequent creators: someone, without taking a step to the side, someone tried to move away from the formed image as much as possible, and someone making a great number of references to it, and sometimes repeating frame by frame. However, all subsequent films of the gangster genre have been created with an eye on The Godfather and tried to reach or even surpass its level (which, in the end, the sequel did two years later).
This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
The best movie ever, the story goes in an elegant way, it doesn't bore you. Also, with the best performances in the history of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando
And yet I came to the conclusion that the godfather, the movie is very eternal, classic, inimitable, this movie belongs to those films that leave a trace, even your communion in it, thanks to the atmosphere created by the music of the Company, and the main Sicilian theme of Godfather, by the greatest actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton. I will not talk about the essence of the book or the movie, what it teaches us, in any case, everyone determines for himself what to take from this movie or book. The book, like the film, are not masterpieces of literature and cinema, they are outside the framework of this space, they have a separate place in the repository, as something special, personal, making you worry, sympathize, not understand, but admire every time. Times are changing, techniques and techniques are being improved, the picture is better, dynamic, films are being made about gangsters, about the underworld. I do not know what the secret of Copolla is, but this movie will remain for me the first among the first. I belong to the generation born.
The film "The Godfather" - watched several times, because it is an amazing film, one of my favorites! The film has a very good cast - Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are great, strong actors. All the actors in this film did their part brilliantly! The film's director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a genius. The music in the film is wonderful, the script is excellent, the film is a masterpiece! This is a movie that everyone should watch at least once. Although the film is about the mafia, about crime, it is still based on human relationships, the lives of people who make mistakes, need help and support in difficult times, about friendship and betrayal. Although the film is long, it consists of three parts, but it looks with great interest, because there are no extra scenes in the film, every moment is interesting! A wonderful family drama, with the cruel rules of the mafia of life, and with an excellent cast! The best, successful film in the cinema about the mafia.
What is The Godfather for us today? We know that this is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema, for most people it is, in principle, the very embodiment of the word "cinema". This is the ideal of authorial dramatic cinema, which is close and understandable to a wide range of viewers. It is an integral part of popular culture, broken into quotes, images and memes.

Although this film has a three-act structure, all the acts are well packed with content. And so the film is watched in one breath. And most importantly, what message ... Each person has the right to decide for himself what meaning was laid down by the author.

What can be written that has not been written already. The Godfather is the classic, genre-defining Mafia movie in which Marlon Brando plays the titular character facing grave threats from rival families. Unsurprisingly, there's constant violence. Characters are shot and killed, often at close range in graphic scenes. Characters are strangled to death and die in car explosions. Domestic abuse is shown: A man beats his wife with a belt. In one of many iconic scenes, a movie executive wakes up covered in blood, with a decapitated horse's head in his bed. In the opening scene, a man asks Don Corleone for vengeance after two men raped and beat his daughter. The movie also has cigarette smoking, wine drinking, and brief nudity (female breasts), and characters are shown having sex, clothed but audible. There are some references made to the sexual behaviors of Sonny and Fredo. In short,this movie is an opera without the music.
This movie was amazing it shows viewers the dynasty of the badass mafia crew who showed their audience the meaning of brotherhood and loyalty as they were faced with challenges throughout the film.
The Godfather is one of those timeless movies that stands as a benchmark for how to craft a true epic that can stand the test of time. Boasting a colorful host of characters, amazing plot twists within its sprawling storyline and impressive cinematography, The Godfather is a classic and easily one of the best crime films ever released. While there are slower moments here and some of the editing feels a little dated, the sheer visceral shock to each individual death and the absorbing storyline are enough to overlook this in what's otherwise a magnificent film.


Up until today, I haven't bothered to review "The Godfather". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews.

Originally there were a lot of objections from some people who didn't like the violence in the movie. Despite all objections, the movie still dazzled and glittered a new beginning of the American cinema.
This film was entertaining and leaves you on the edge of your seat. Marlo Brandon and a few others really outdid themselves in this film. Phenomenal all around. Amazing cast. Amazing camera work and lighting!
This is the best movie of my lifetime. And of course, Marlon Brando being the best of the best.

Loved it. The acting is great and the shots look amazing. Can watch is over and over again Loved it. The acting is great and the shots look amazing. Can watch is over and over again.
The Godfather is one of the greatest american movies ever created. It is a classic. Why? well if for no other reason The Godfather should be considered a classic form being the first movie to have the entire audince routing for the bad guys. It made it ok to be a criminal so long as you had honor. On side note the transformation of Micheal from war hero and all around good guy to the Mob Don is great, the way he can go from being so normal to being the Don that strikes fear into the viewers is amazing.

A classic movie. This is a movie that left a huge impression on me when I first watched it when I was 15 years old. The godfather character left a deep impression, the actor immersed himself in the role.
As I see it, the story is usually read as the descent into evil of an innocent. But I seethe story of an innocent awakening to something that he must conclude. When Michael Corleone is in hiding in Sicily, he falls truly in love. He is very happy, when the life he is in hiding from reaches out to destroy his beloved. He sees that he can bring it to an end, and that he must do it. Even though he will have to assume a role immersed in this terrible world, and appear to do terrible things. He is a man who has seen his fate. In it's period context, this is an allegory of Europe realising that Fascism must be stopped.

This is the tragedy of The Godfather part 3; it was a wasted opportunity for a truly enlightening trilogy. I wish someone had pointed this out to Coppola.

This is an amazing movie. I would recommend it to anyone. It makes you feel like a part of the "family". After watching the movie, you feel like these are real people, no actors. It's hard to believe that Puzo invented these characters.
Nice movie. It has an amazing set of actors. I like this movie. This movie is perfect. I give 10 star. God father is one of the top movie in imdp. Thank you.
There are many reasons that I say that The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen. For one, though it was made in the 70s, 1972 to be exact, it feels very modern. It's truly a timeless classic. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed and co-wrote the film, did an amazing job in the making of this film. The screenplay, which was co-written by Mario Puzo who also wrote the book of the same name, is the best that I have heard in any movie. Then there is the acting, which I think is not only the best ensemble of acting in a movie, but also that Marlon Brando, who in my opinion is one of the all-time greatest actors, put on the best performance in the role of Don Vito Corleone than any other actor did for any movie and any character. It is incredible to watch. There is no question why he won the Oscar for best actor, as well as the film winning for best adapted screenplay and for best picture. A must watch for any movie lover. It's "an offer you can't refuse".
I recently saw this in cinemas for the first time, andi was blown away. Every aspect was just incredible, the acting, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography. Its all superb.

A masterclass in filmmaking. The Godfather is the best film of all time I'd argue the case that it is. This is the ultimate gangster movie.

THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.
One of the most captivating TV dramas of our time, especially the first and mostly the second film. I feel a similar captivating element in Tulsa King featuring Sylvester Stallone with the sharpness of tactics and strategies of quick planning to counteract, and quickly. I also love the elegance of style, the well-dressed suits. After a showdown, off to the Peninsula for dinner with maybe minor scratches, sweet too. For the God Father, the characters were very believable especially played in the early years. Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia...well, all of the characters. So rich.
Best movie ever made, by far my favorite movie. All the actors put so much passion in this movie that you can feel it Nothing mentioning the song track , AMAZING ,expecially the wedding scene.

I watched this in 2022, because netflix beforely not buy the license. When i watch this movie at that moment i fall in love. This movie was crazy. This movie was made at 1970 but it still relevant for us in 2022. I love you don carleone. I hope film industry can make more beautifull film like this.

My favorite scene when michael meet his wife at italy, the girl was so beautifull and michael carleone get love at the first sight, but sadly the women died in car explosive accident.

Michael become a god father was so gargerous. He is my idol, my life change after watch this movie, always be the best film ever.

I will wrote my Review in french best movie ever.

Ce film est le meilleur film de l'histoire du cinéma. Un casting de rêve, des sentiments peints et dépeints, une maîtrise musicale et photographique. Le chef d'oeuvre.
When you see this film you just would like to still feeling the amazing acting , decorations and whole environment , its really recommended to watch this film
I am a chinese man and find that america has a beautiful culture, and this movie show the struggle of being an immigrant and having to struggle to live the american dream which is not easy. You can thrive in this land or die trying. Must watch!


The reason I do not give The Godfather a 10 out of 10 is because it is not the perfect movie. And the reason why The Godfather is not the perfect movie is because it drags. The movie drags for 3 hours and I have to admit that Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a little overrated. I understand his amazing acting ability but i actually thought De Niro did a better job in Part 2. Pacino as Michael is one of the greatest performances in modern cinema. His performance ranks right up there with De Niro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, Ray Liotta in Goodfellas, and Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption. I love the Godfather although I do understand the criticism the movie receives from people. (too long, boring at times)
This movie is amazing, super insightful and motivating. Wonderful movie. I personally want there to be more interaction. Overall masterpiece this movie will forverbe apart of the greatest made in history of movie.


Definitely Don't Miss A Opportunity To Rent This Film:
This is the most posh movie I've seen 30 years ago. It remains that way for me to this day. Great actors and amazing acting. Even after 100 years, this film will be at the top of cinema.
Not too much, for me this is the best movie ever seen. It offers business lessons that no one else can teach. I and the ISO Logistics brand have applied and implemented in business extremely effectively.

THE MOVIE AWESOME THE WRITING AND ACTORS AMAZING! THE LIFE LESSONS I LEARNED WATCHING LIFE CHANGING! THIS A MOVIE I WATCHED EVERY YEAR WITH MY FATHER SINCE I WAS A SMALL CHILD. EVERY YEAR I WATCH THIS MOVIE I LEARN SOMETHING NEW ABOUT BUSINESS FAMILY LIFE AND SACRAFICE.
If you haven't watched this movie.. do watch it.

It has everything that a movie should have. Crime, drama, emotion, love and everything else that a good movie needs.
Old movie for sure, but everything is as good as it gets.

The story, the cinematography, the music, ICONIC!

I'd love to see new movies being created with the same ideology: story is KING.
Should be nr.1 movie.

Its the best movie of all times I used to watch it when I was a little kid and I still watch it sometimes.

Great story.

The film is perfect and only people who dont understand would't watch it.

Gangsta movies are always a choice. Lol.
I love this movie.

Because this movie changed my life.

I decide to be a writer and movie director for the 'Godfather'

I always wanted to be a part of beautiful story, powerful performance of directing and co-work with great actors.
Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. "Citizen Kane" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did "Gone With the Wind" or "2001: A Space Odyssey". "The Godfather" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.
I liked the movie very much because it talks about an important issue and the direction was a masterpiece literally, and I loved the actors and the writer excelled in his wonderful artistic writing like all his previous films.
No, so just give it 10 out of 10 and move on.

One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.

Like the movie. A great one. I have watch all og them.

One of the strengths of the film is its masterful storytelling, which is both suspenseful and emotionally engaging. The themes of loyalty, power, and family are explored in depth, and the film's characters are richly drawn and well-developed. The cinematography, score, and attention to detail also contribute to the film's high quality.

Overall, "The Godfather" is a masterpiece of filmmaking and one of the greatest films of all time. Its impact on popular culture is immeasurable, and it remains a must-see for fans of crime dramas and classic cinema.
One of the top and most rated movie of our generation, everyone should watch this. One of the top and most rated movie of our generation, everyone should watch this. One of the top and most rated movie of our generation, everyone should watch this.
So of a Good Movie.

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.

Wow .... series. Fully fantastic Wow .... series. Fully fantastic Wow .... series. Fully fantastic Wow .... series. Fully fantastic Wow .... series. Fully fantastic Wow .... series.

This is THE movie. The MJ of movies. GOATed.

The Godfather 2 might be better in some ways (de Niro), but at the end of the day it is just the second movie.

The music, the actors, the storyline - everything is top notch. Nothing to complain. Ten out of ten.
The Godfather is a movie that has truly earned its place in cinematic history. The film is an expertly crafted exploration of the world of organized crime, showcasing the gritty realities of this violent and dangerous world while also delving into the complex relationships between the characters. The acting is top-notch, with Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone being particularly memorable. The film's pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the story and the characters. The music, cinematography, and direction are all masterful, making "The Godfather" a movie that is both emotionally intense and intellectually stimulating. In my opinion, this is a film that every cinema lover should experience at least once in their lifetime.
This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not only that but it is the only series of movies that have all been as good as the first. Considering the fact that most sequels and trilogies basically lose all of their luster after the first film, that is really saying something.
Hhcquan1_dp: A classic work, no matter how long, it always deserves to be the "godfather" of the world literature village. Hopefully world literature will have many such good works.
It's not my personal #1 movie of all time, but after finally watching it I can understand why it's usually regarded as the greatest by so many. It can seem a little dated at times, but for a film that is over thirty years old it still stands up. Slow and deliberate, the movie shows that if you have an attention span of longer than 30 seconds you don't have to have action in every scene. Which is why when something does happen it is so shocking and unpredictable.

I was surprised at how little Brando was actually in the movie. I thought Pacino was much more impressive, but there's no denying Brando's presence on the screen.

My favorite quote: "Leave the gun.....Take the cannolis."


Oh my God!

What a absolutely amazing film. I, among millions of others think that it is the greatest motion picture of all time, and it is. (living proof: the IMDb's own top 250 -- you'll see that the godfather is a clear number one

in summary, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic is brilliant!!
The Godfather is one of my top ten favorite films.
I love this film, it's really chilling when you watch it and this is why I love acting.The actors created a really believable performances. I hope one day when I get into films , that I would manage to do a action films and dress up as mafias. I would definitely recommend this film. If you are looking for ideas to prank or get revenge this film is worth watching.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part- III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
Amazing character development. Sound was carefully woven into every scene. One word: masterpiece.

One of the best films of all time, with some of the best actors of all time. Godfather 1, 2 and 3 are a must see for all ages.

I dont know what to say it s great you should watch it
Unlocks the raw reality of the life and lifestyle of a notorious drug king pin. Acting, choreography and directing impeccable.
I got to watch the fourth bonus DVD celebrating 25 years of the first movie, after watching the behind scenes and the work done by the film crew, I cant agree more that his movie is the best ever made. I watched the fourth DVD which includes the Godfather Notebook, it's how Coppola wrote the script for the movie on the exact papers of the original novel by cutting every single page of the novel and paste it in an A4 frame that will make the footnote bugger so he can write the script on each page of the original novel. Some of the greatest scenes were Coppola first hearing the sound track by Nino Rota on a cassette tape, and Robert De Niro playing the role of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone during the casting for the role. It's really a very good DVD and it shows how a great movie was done.
An exceptional classic film!

I have many words of praise and I don't know where to start... Any word is superfluous. It's like trying to describe a historical work of art. It is enough to look at it.

The film is impressive, which makes you break away from reality and teleport to those times. Exceptional direction, with formidable actors who fit the characters very well, and the script and the frames are also exceptional.
The test of a great movie is that it can be watched over and over. The Godfather matches that criterion in spades.

Made when all the actors could be heard and understood, The background musical accompaniment never took over and the casting from top to bottom was impeccable.

Perfection.
I saw this movie when i was studying in a university, reaaly this is so impressive , that a child reached in USA and became the head of mafia and criminal, he prove him self as a godfather he was involve in every field of life especially politics.
I love this movie. One of my fav movies to watch I this at least once a month. Maybe 4 times a month lol. They all did a great job. How did they get so many legends in one movie that is crazy, this go down in history as one of the greatest gangster movies of all time.
Perfect defination of masterpiece . Seeing the world's greatest actors together in their greatest roles ever played . Most perfect acting , set decoration , cinematography , directing and story medium.
I highly enjoyed this movie. Title is perfect for the context of the movie. Therefore, I rate this movie 8 stars! This American Crime film was a pleasure to watch.

The godfather is a film that everyone should see once in there life.

The very good at setting in america and Italy are so good, Marlin Brando RIP plays a In unsettling an impressing act as Mob boss.
It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.
I got acquainted with the human side of the criminal world in a distinctive way that sympathizes with the hero a lot, and it was confirmed that such a world has a great price that must be paid in this world as it is paid in the hereafter.
I love this way of mafia for contorles everything. And actualy makes more serieusly and better ideas for doing business.

By the way my review just in this categorys of movies thats all.
IOT IS A VERY GOOD. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. THE MORE YOU WATCH THE MORE YOU DEVELOP INTREST .IT IS A MUST TO WATCH. EVERY ONE SHIULD WATCH THIS ONE TIME ATLEAST.

The Godfather happens t be one of those films i grew up with loving the plot and everything about it. So believable in all facets.

One thing readily comes to mind, the shootings and the killings, was that how people took laws into their hands ?, i keep asking myself if that really portrays how life was lived in the late 60's (sixties) and early 70's (seventies), and the law enforcement agents could do absolutely nothing to curb the situation.

Well away from its brutal killings ad violence it's very entertaining. In all i think Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing work of art. To me it's an all time classic, the acting, the directing all on point. I mean its just the movie to watch. What's more its ever so green.
If you saw the movie , please read the book too , the movie and the book are flawless and amazing. Even in 2022 , its a top notch ! Young alpacino is very good and the second part is the best. One of good trilogy and movies.
And it hasn't aged a bit! I watch it and rewatch it and never get tired of it. Marlon Brando gave the most brilliant acting performance. Al Pacino is also unforgettable.

Well, I kind of like that movie. I thought she did a really good job. ... I really like that movie. ... i love this movie, ... I really enjoy writing about his plots.
Up until today, I haven't bothered to review "The Godfather". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?!

So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.
There is next to no that I can add to the audits on here, that have made sense of what is the big deal about The Godfather so well. I have seen many astonishing films, as well as some clunkers, however The Godfather was past astounding. There are such countless pictures, subtleties and scenes that I genuinely can't escape my head since watching it interestingly only nine hours prior. The Godfather is so extraordinarily very much made and acted that it stands apart among most of those other astounding movies I've seen, to such an extent I was unable to consider a solitary blemish, and I am battling to consider a sufficient motivation to why I didn't see this film before now. Really good choice, Amazing post thanks for sharing.
There are some movies for youth, some for the old people, some for women, some for men, etc... but The Godfather is the one that can be seen by anyone cause its message of life is understood by the whole world. Is the best movie of all time and represents an spectacular piece of work for any actor or director.

The Godfather is the most famous and influential film in cinematic history. It follows a family as it is torn apart by power, greed, and love. From an author's point of view, it can be seen as a long-form "mini-series" (the three films tell three distinct stories that are bridged together by the main character). Not only do we see great acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino but also a great score by Nino Rota. The film has been adapted into two separate book-length studies, one from Director Coppola that focuses more on the historical context of the times and characters, focusing more on its political aspects, and another from Professor Wolf who argues that it is not just about the action on screen but also how every aspect of the film contributes to creating such an intense feeling as if you were there yourself with all its implications about family, loyalty, revenge and much more for which we will give our own personal commentary below.
I really enjoyed this movie and I love everything with this movie!!
I think that the topic, characters, settings... etc all parts of this movie is excellent! I can watch this movie 10000 times. Main character describes some truths about the world! I gave 10 start out of 10. I will watch this movie with my grand grand children :) Firstly people think that it is only a gangster film but it is more than this. It includes the reality of the world, it gives details about the life! Other characters also have a good role play but main character will not be forgotten in the future i think. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay written by Mario Puzo and Coppola. The movie is based on Italian-American Mafia member Joseph "Joe" Bonanza's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. It follows the story of Michael Corleone, a mafia kingpin who attempts to legitimize his criminal enterprise and keep his family from being torn apart.

The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, who becomes involved in organized crime at the age of twenty, after being forced into it by his father Don Vito Corleone to protect their family from a rival gang and corrupt police officers. Michael is put under.


Terrific movie making that doesn't get much better.



Simply amazing movie. Classic, have watched this title s few times, it does not get old no matter how many times you watch it.

A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Simply a masterpiece :)

This was the best ever in my whole life. Uive never been such amazed by any movie in my life, carakter were so amazingly played.

Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he also wrote with Mario P, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a good look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone. Of course I recommend it!
Author Mario Puzo made The Godfather a classic, when he wrote about the mafia but didn't talk much about drugs, blood and gambling, but focused on describing the plots, events of the family, how each member of the family improvising with difficulties. The temperament of the "small tycoons" is thereby also clearly depicted. In the midst of the storm, there are cowards who run away, there are people who turn their backs on betrayal, there are brute force who use violence to suppress and then die in an instant. After all, the people who seem weak at first end up doing great karma, and the smartest person to plan everything, is none other than the Godfather!
The film,, presents the story of a man during an American labor movement where labor was depicted to be too intricate and prosperous to care for the underprivileged. The labor movement portrayed in the movie is perceived to be extremely powerful, powerful to the extent that its interests are always met. The movie is set in the present day (1979) rural south with the protagonist Norma Rae, a Southern mill worker with two children. The film provides a significant evaluation of the radicalism that was portrayedby southern managers and how they learned to oppress the unprivileged when they were able to resist their legal rights.
Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.

I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.
Watching this as a kid changed me. I wanted to be a mobster for a while. Cool suits, women and money?! Of Course but once I got older I understood that was a dangerous life but still admired these guys because yes it was a movie but it was someone's real life also. Almost a bio pic if you will. Amazing movie about the mob, loyal, money, power, family & Respect. The Godfather is one of those all time classics. It almost timeless. This movie was the start of it all. It was eye opening to see how mobsters operated, and the crazy life they lived. I believe this movie is the closest to the real thing you can get.
Real life mob movie captures true to life life Mob crime. Very detailed with great acting! Superb cast! Definitely will leave you wanting to learn more. This movie sparked a Hollywood interest and paved the way for several other mob movies to hit the scene. Many of these actors are so convincing with their mob look and talk that they have starred in several other mob movies. With movies still being released to this date featuring some of these very actors. These movies feed into Americas fascination with the mob and keep people wanting to see more. If you are just starting into mob movies this movie is definitely the mob movie you must start with!
This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

The godfather movie have best quality and a lot of action , I really enjoyed the movie it's pretty amazing it would be best if were more action with those persons. I watched two times For the best A M A Z I N G the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring
The best cinematic version while being a thorough watcheye & never to be missed , that this piece of art is totally ethereal. It was 5 am in the morning and , I was going through my high and lows of paternal historical silence that made me feel like dwelling to search on something that can portrait god parents , whereby Godfather - title in itself was so ebullient. That's totally worth watching and indulgence of such masterpiece can't be left in spaces. Never too late for a bounded inspirational movies like where we can articulate our thoughts , feeling and in-facts morals too. The God Father is must watch.
The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. Clouduck. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as.

Really impressed with the main male role of the film, he is the soul of the film. Although launched a long time ago, the value it brings remains the same. This movie is definitely an inspiration to many writers, directors and actors of the next generation. I often watch gentle movies, mafia-themed movies that make my emotions not good because too many 18+ scenes. However the reputation of the key set got me curious and I ended up looking at it. I have watched this movie many times and even bought books to read. I think the people around me should see it - An excellent work of world cinema. I give it a 9 because I don't like violent movies, that's all.

The best movie of all time! With the best actors! Top 10! Love it!

This is not an ordinary movie related to the mafia, this is a lesson for life, which has really been full of different meanings for me watching it deeply many times.

Actors who can only be praised I am glad that I was born in a period where I could watch the Godfather trilogy This movie should be on the list of the top 250 movies of history, it should also be on the list of the best movies ever made on the planet.

No comment can be given on this item in this list except for definition.

Thank you very much for the existence of such actors and directors.

We hope that at least one such movie will be made again in the future.

Hi!! My favorite film is The GoodFather. It was made in Japan. I knew this film, when I played game. The game was collaboration with . I want to tell you! GoodFather is very interesting!

I am eleven years old, but i like all the back to future's films, they are very good, the story is very good and when i wacthed the first film, i didn't know that the film was old XD, i think the films were a little bit.

My favorite movie is Back to the Future 2. Its about a teenager that travels to the future to help his son and daugther. But he fails and has to fix the mistakes he 've done.

My favourite film is batman, because it's very fascinating.

If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on the best movie in movie history.
The Godfather is my utmost favorite movie. I have watched it numbers of times and i always learn from it. its an institution for me. Thanks A lot
The Best movie ever. I'm still enjoying watch it again.
I have only seen THE GODFATHER twice but is already one of my favorite films ever. Some of the ideas in this film are very, very creative. Espcially the part where Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) goes to the Italian resturaunt to kill the two men, but he knows they will search him. So he gets one of his friends to hide one in a bathroom stall. Isn't that brilliant. The performances are excellent. James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino. All great. What I don't get is why Marlon Brando agreed to portray in this film, but claimed his one of the worst experiences of his life. I think they could have chose someone a bit better for the role of Vito Corleone. Other than that, this movie is awesome. Everyone should see this. 175 minutes of family, action, drama, and murder. Why else would it be the #1 film on the Top 250 Films of All Time list.
A true cinematic masterpiece! A movie that holds up strongly through time. Brando's performance was impeccable! One of the best casts in the history of cinema. This movie was done with the passion that lacks on film making nowadays and thats why it will live forever. It deals with the core of society through a dangerous and loving family. There is just a few film makers out there that keep this true formula alive today and let's hope there is more to come. Coppola has yet to come back and delight us with more. We need more movies like this! Get inspired filmmakers, the world is yours. A movie that changed American film making forever.
Most amazing movie one of my fav all the time. I dont know how many times i've watched this movie but you can watch it over and over again.
Has anyone found any interesting mistakes in this film? -- I found one were Don Corleone is being moved in the hospital. He moves his hand very quickly when being taken into the new hospital room even though he isn't supposed to be awake. - There are also some time/space inconsistencies in the scene where Michael shoots the police captain, but I've heard they removed in mistake in later versions of the film. Also, some of the lines at the end of the movie with Don and Michael talking in the olive garden seem to be out of order or ad libbed. -- I've heard that there are others. Just Curious - please let me know! :) Thanks! --
Best directed and acted movie ever! Too many great things too name about this movie. From the costumes to the music. Everything is superb!!


I found this movie to be disappointing in terms of story, narrative and authenticity.


I think this movie is perfect, it's the best movie ever made in history. It's by far a must see movie if your into the mafia and i know iam. This movie out plays every other mafia movie out there, there is no mafia movie to beat it and at that no movie period to beat it. Trust me and see this movie.
This is an oldie but a good. I can watch this movie over and over without getting bored. If you want some up beat watch your back style movie then don't hesitate in watching this flick. Overall I give it a 9 out of a 10 simply because I usually never give any movie a perfect score. Do I recommend this movie? Yes I certainly do. So kick back and relax your in for 1 heck of a ride..
Masterpiece for the human history. I believe even 1000 year after this will be the top 10 still
Great acting, great storytelling, and compelling images all add up to make The Godfather one of the best movies of all time. From the opening frames to the final scene, one cannot help but be mesmerized with the intriguing and fascinating story of Don Vito and his family. This is a picture of epic proprtions which features outstanding performances by veteran actors Brando, Caan, Duvall and Hayden; and equally spellbinding performances by relatively newcomers Pacino, Shire, and Keaton. This is one of those rare movies where seeing it once, twice, or even three times is really not nearly enough to fully enjoy the greatness of this cinematic event. This may not be the greatest movie ever made, but if it isn't, it certainly is one of the top five. A definite must see!
It's really a good movie that makes you interact with the Events.
Simply put, The Godfather is the best film ever made. From story, to direction, to screenplay, to acting, to sound and music, to editing, and in particular, to the overall importance of cinema as a medium, there is no equal to The Godfather. Only this brief paragraph is needed to voice my comments on this film; many others in and out of the movie critic circle have already written volumes on the subject.

One little parting note... A good piece of advice I always give to my friends and family whenever I hear them lamenting and complaining about poor films they have recently seen: "whenever you start to feel that movies are not measuring up anymore, that no one is making a movie that means anything, that Hollywood is out of touch, etc., go home and watch The Godfather again. The experience will remind you of what movies, when at their absolute best, are capable of achieving."
Masterpiece of all time! Mario Puzo taking rebirth in every frame.
I don't understand what is so special about this movie.Its long,boring,and drawn out.I love Al Pacino but i seriously doubt this launched his career.There has been much greater mob movies made that surpass this one entirely.I seen it thinking WOW all these great actors it must be great as everyone is saying,but i found it dull and could barely stay awake!My score 2/10.

a lot people her bash this movie as being boring.I read their comments and it seems they only like the violent parts cause that's all they could remember. But really the story is about how Mike,a normally nice guy(college boy,apple of his daddies eye)becomes a cold hearted monster this is the tragedy of this story( which is it's greatest asset)I was very engaged by all the characters I even know names and lines of the movie. As a kid I didn't understand it and couldn't watch it and I loved gangster movies. But as I got older I finally understood the movie. The violence only makes the point of Mike's turn even stronger as he shows no remorse for what he has done. In the beginning of the movie he tells Kay the story of Johnny Fontane's contract. But he basically tells her that's how my family operates,not me. Then as the film pushes on he becomes worse then his father ever was because he kills with no remorse and does only what his mind tells him instead of listening to his heart sometimes( classic struggle). In my opinion this is one of the greatest films ever!!!!!!

Since 1972 lots of words have been said. I think that there are just 2 options: -or you let me write nineteen full books about that, -or you better watch it, even if you think it is not your kind of film. Just watch it. It's really the top. Just a little of it i can say, just like a mirror. It is the top about Marlon Brando working. Even better than his acting in Apocalypse now or...anything else... You can understand it above all in the interview released in the post production period. Some of the particulars which made his character such complete, have been just an intuition of Marlon Brando or Francis Ford Coppola. This thing has been taken like an example for all the cast and... that's the result.
I wouldn't believe it if someone else told me that this movie would be so special. One of the most beautiful movies ever made. Flawless acting, editing, music... It is even more binding as it is a film series.
The Godfather trilogy is probably the best movie series about underground mafias and families. Each part challenges the other by doing so,The Godfather Trilogy became the classics that will last till the end of the World.

It makes you feel scared, brave, romantic, and sometimes cruel. Watching it reminds you the value of your life and how it is not valued sometimes when the matter is your honor.

I believe there won't be any other film that can ever again tell the story of underworld and its rules.

Thank you Francis Ford Coppola
1. The acting. Every performance in this film is believable. You forget they are acting and really believe they are the characters. 2. The pace. Not too slow, not too fast, just right. 3. The music. Perfect! 4. Character introduction, character development. All the major characters are introduced in a way, and then you see how they change. 5. The details, sounds, etc. You really get the sense of the decade they are in. The phones, cars, restaurants etc all feel authentic. 6. There is a love story, but too mushy, and it does not detract from the film. 7. There is some comedy, but in small subtle doses, and does not take away the serious of the film. 8. Suspense and surprises. 9. the most memorable opening scene of all time, arguably. 10. The impact on pop culture. Scenes, lines, etc. That are now part of our every day vocabulary.
It's a great movie which shows very well the structure and working methods of the Italian-American mafia. The excellent interpretation of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and all the others makes this movie one you must see. The great screenplay based in the Mario Puzo's novel gives to this movie a very strong story. You can also see a very good representation of the Italian lifestyle in the USA and the original Sicilian mafia. Each character has his own presence and they interact as in the real life. For me it's probably the best movie of the history, followed by the second and third part of the Mario Puzo's story.
This is the best movie of all time. It has everything a good movie should have. Nobody can not enjoy this movie if they are decently intelligent. It is THE BEST DRAMA/CRIME MOVIE of all time, for sure, and it is my favorite movie of all time. It is Marlon Brando at his best. When people think of Brando, they usually first think of the Godfather. If you haven't seen this movie, WATCH IT!! You are missing out on an excellent piece of film history. There will never be a drama film more powerful than the Godfather.
Widely viewed around the world as one of the best American films ever made, the opening movie from the crime saga The Godfather is a milestone of cinema history. The Godfather, together with Star Wars, from 1972 has become one of the most parodied movies ever. Director Francis Ford Coppola paints an amazing portrait of the Corleone clan's rise and near fall from power in the US as well as in Italy. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully manages to balance the story between the Corleone's family life and the vast crime business in which they are engaged.The story views the Mafia from the inside as Francis Ford Coppola saw it, and as Mario Puzo did when he originally wrote the book in which he portrayed the story presented here. This movie is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon, capicce.
Well... if I had to choose the ultimate Gangsta movie to review this tops the list! Action..Crime..Suspense to name a few are all included in this flick, and it does not disappoint. This is your go-to movie when you want to feel like the ultimate CRIME BOSS (minus the jail time)Definitely one of Francis Ford Coppola best films. He really captures the essence of the lifestyle these Good fellas have. In retrospect he breathes life into the characters that already hold enough personality for an entire football team. If I had to rate it between one and ten I would say a seven, only because the movie is so damn dark you feel like the director shot the entire flick at night!
A true classic. I love the Godfather trilogy. It's #1 on my list and it will stay that way. Al Pacino is so incredible in this movie. I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Michael Corleone as Pacino did. He is such an intense actor...the best actor in my opinion.
This is the best movie i ever seen in my life ! It is simply a great movie with great actors and great director
Made 15 years before I was born, I didn't watch this film until I bought the trilogy a couple years back. And I was not disappointed. How could I be? Francis Ford Coppola has gifted us with what is quite frankly, the greatest gangster film of all time. Goodfellas, The Departed, Reservoir Dogs and other great films of this genre cannot even touch the pure brilliance of this film. There is such an inexplicable gulf between The Godfather and every mob movie ever made. It does not allow you to take your eyes off the screen for even one second.

Perfectly written and directed, there is not a single fault in this film. For me, Brando just steals the show. He makes you believe that he IS Vito Corleone. Just a sensational, legendary film.
I read the book written by Mario Puzo 10 years ago. The book is one of my favourits. Francis Ford Coppola and his crew has succesfully imagined the story to an outstanding movie. It took me ten years to realize that i was ready to see it. I can't wait ten years too see part two...
This is great filmmaking. I've seen this film countless times, and it still takes my breath away. There is not a single false step in the casting or the performances, and the movie has a lot to say about power, corruption, family, pride and America. As I write this the sprawling and excellent Lord of the Rings trilogy is getting a lot of ink for its multiple layers of Meaning, but of course that is a fable. The Godfather seems as real as can be.
Unmissable! Great cinema, great performances, from a great director. A must see
The godfather trilogy is best movie of all time.everything in godfather is perfect. from directing to acting and soundtrack and everythig...
Director Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place!!!
There aren't even enough words in the English language to describe the incredible mastermind portrayed in The Godfather. From the times of the original Don Vito Corleone to the end of the reign of Michael Corleone, the family was well kept on balance. This saga taught so many principles that it might take one years to learn. It was spellbinding, captivating, and overall a long-living masterpiece.
Of course it had to be #1 movie in the whole world!!!! Its a masterpiece!!! Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton,etc., WOW I don't have words, they are the best. Excellent Movie!!! The story really got me, especially Al Pacino's performance because you can't really see what Mr.Pacino is thinking and it scares you, his stare just impacts anyone!!! WOW Excellent Performance!!!
I watched this film behind my parents as an early age and had great impact on me. I wouldn't recommend to allow your kids to watch but I have to admit is simply amazing.
The best film forever!!!!! The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
The Godfather is possibly one of the best constructed films I have ever seen: the lighting and colouring are perfect, giving every frame an almost painting like quality; the camera work is brilliantly modest; and the film hosts some of the greatest acting ever committed to celluloid.

However, there is something about the film which stops me from becoming as emotionally involved as I feel I could have been. Maybe its just the story itself, which I personally cannot connect to. It feels cold, but I'm sure that's the intention.

So, definitely one of the greatest films ever made, however I cannot agree with other posts claiming it is a better film than Citizen Kane.
I didnt see The Godfather trilogy until very recently. I heard about it's greatness from everywhere, so I decided to take look at them. By far, I thought that The Godfather was a great movie, because not only is it a great Mafia/Cosa Nostra movie, it subtly throws in messages of the importance of family and respect. That is why I think this movie is a ten. The Godfather will stand the test of time, and it will be a movie I want my kids to see (when theyre a little older of course).
The best gangster film I've seen in my life. This is the reference for most of the gangster movies made in my language. The dialogues in the movies are great. And the MUSIc is just WOW! Background score is great!

The story, the characters, the families and the acting. This is the greatest of all time indeed. How Michael goes from being the war hero non- criminal, to become the leader of the biggest crime family is just amazing. But the best thing about the movie is Marlon Brando's performance. Just astonishing and it will be remembered as one of the greatest acting performances in film. I love how the conflicts build up during the movie, and that they can not trust anyone except their own family. If you love mob and crime movies, this is one for you. The music is also terrific, it fits the scenes perfectly. It is a great directed movie by Francis Ford Coppola and he keeps up the impressing work in The Godfather Part 2. The first 2 months I watched this movie 6 times, and the number is still increasing. Can not get enough. 10/10
You need to watch this movie beyond be a mark in the history of cinema, Coppola add a new way to direct, you get so involved with the history and the things that start to happen that really don't realize how long the film is. The film also have a incredible production and keep the majority fidelity possible with the book just have little things missing and others not add. In the first scene you can realize how Coppola was super careful in details of the movie the typical big wedding in a Italian shape same being in USA, the songs and way people dance and get connected you feel like watching not a move but a oracle crystal ball where you can see everything happening rich of details and feelings.
If you can embody the power of "The Godfather" you can do anything!
Simply the most deep drama i've ever witnessed, my favorite movie of all time, such a beautiful harmony, smooth narration, stunning music and especially outstanding acting by Marlon Brondo. Francis ford Coppola along with the score from Nino Rota delivered the most complete drama experience ever on the big screen.the transition of Mike from a man who defends Honor and law to the completely opposite, driven by the love of his family i watched the movie long time ago when i was very young so i couldn't understand his beauty, i re-watched it more than 2 times now and every time is the same effect, you keep thinking of the story and the act for the coming weeks, Godfather is undoubtedly a rare masterpiece.
Great move as previous and next part. The plot of the movie is actual today and can be seen in real life.
The best movie, the best actor, the best director and the best writer !!!

If you watch this movie , you will see the real world. The real world is not like you think... the real world 99% you can see it , and learn from this movie... You have to watch this movie 100% !

Best Regards
I think this film shown different believes between one man, that i think was a good mad in this film, and all of world as rule of out side people
If you want a portrait of all that is wrong with America, look not only at this film but the fact that so many people have immortilized this overrated, grossly violent movie with no redeeming qualities. This shouldn't even be top 1000. It's boring, WAY too long and has terrible story writing and pacing. Who the hell loves this atrocity???

I made my day by watching "The Godfather". When i was finished with it i just thought i have now watched The Godfather of all movies. The acting was spectacular. I could not have imagined a Drama movie could be so fun to have watched.
the magic of time films

back, is not achieved in these times, failure to carry humanity, even to be violent you have to have humanity that is the magic of a film, and not those of now that only draw violence and free blood they do not make you feel that you are watching a movie but it seems that you are watching the news
Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. the people that dislike the film is just to blow their own mind, everybody recognizes the complex and beauty of the movie. It has a lot of goofs, although, but that doesn't make the film look silly. the mistakes are stupid, like a wine that doesn't exist on that time and etc. 10/10 is my grade to this movie that will be in our minds forever, because the good wine always taste good
The film is pretty much near-perfect, what else is there to say. If you haven't seen it, watch it.
The Godfather is the film is ready to watch for me every couple months or less. Amazing on how our past existed with the best that care for their families, and people that respect them forever. Likely my favorite movie of all time.
It's a travesty that this movie hasn't picked up more Oscar awards. I mean, Al Pacino's nomination was for Best Supporting Actor... give me a break. Honestly, I don't see how this masterpiece din't take home at least 10 golden statuettes. It took so much guts and fight from Ruddy and Coppola to deliver what we see on screen. As filmmakers and cinema lovers, we are all indebted to the filmmakers, cast, and crew for pulling resources, putting up with threats of being fired, and ultimately giving it all for this movie to come together. I must have seen it 50 times in its 50 years since the release and it's a treat to my senses every time.
I'm a bit different than most 14 year old guys that love 2 fast 2 furious. My favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption and I love watching classics. Anyway, after numerous people telling me that they would literally kick my ass unless i saw this movien and the rest, I decided to do it. I've yet to watch Part II & III. Anyway, I really liked this movie. The acting was superb by all, and there's no need to beat a dead horse (pun intended:P) by saying that Pacino and Brando are unbelievable. Although I didn't LOVE it as incredibly much as some people, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I can't wait to see the next two parts.

8/10

Undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.

Francis Ford Coppola is not only responsible for this masterpiece, but also for its sophomore release, which is also in my top 10 list of films, along with another classic, Apocalypse Now.
An instant classic...marvelous acting, beautiful cinematography, and a perfect musical score. Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel is possibly the greatest film ever made. Simply riveting from beginning to end. This movie stands the test of time, even more than 30 years later. The epic saga of the Corleone family is the first and only movie of it's genre to win best picture. A must for your DVD collection.

10/10
Quiet but exciting. Nasty at some moments but soft and tender at the same time in others. People being fair and cruel simultaneously. It´s just the way life is.Wonderful All the stuff is perfect. Perfect sound and music. One of the best photography ever made in Hollywood. Excellent rihtm of the happenings. None of the actors is less than perfect.
This film has become a cult movie has sorts. No wonder people have seen criticizing it because of the attention it gets and complain about its length. I had the same views while i watched it for the first time. But this film grows on you. People who acquire a taste for the art of film will like this film. The way we journey through a man's life is exciting and refreshing. This movie has set a benchmark in every aspect from dialogues which are its main strength to its performances from powerhouses like Al Pacino and Marlin Brando is a treat to watch. Overall if your a fan of crime stories this movie has to be in your bucket list
Excellent tempo the Director has maintained throughout the movie marvelous taking and beautiful screenplay added to its best. I should congratulate the Director and the Producer for their participation in the movie, from the acting side Al Pacino did his best part in the movie Marlon Brando has lived in his portion. As far as re-recording is concern is excellent Photography at its best part of the movie, dialogues are moving, but one thing I could not understand how these people (behind the screen) got an idea to present in this manner? They presented this movie in such a way that it was so realistic that nobody can imagine. I never saw such a beautiful movie in my whole career in India.
The best acting in history of cinema.RIP Marlon Brando
Its a best movie ever that i watch. i think i never have a chance to have taht feel again when i saw godfather.
I don't tend to re-watch films, but the Godfather has been one of the few films I have not only re-watched countless times, but enjoyed every second of.

I recommend it to anyone who professes to be interested in films in any way.

I can't imagine a more solid film. This is one movie I don't get tired of watching. Whether it is the acting, the story, or the dialogue, The Godfather delivers. Brando is the quintessential mafioso, and Pacino is convincing as the "black sheep" of the family who comes to realize his true calling when his family needs him most. His transformation is well told - it does not come as a surprise; it does not seem contrived. The supporting cast is solid as well. I couldn't recommend it more highly.
Very few films of today can compete with The Godfather (1972). This is a must see for all movie buffs, and chances are you've already seen or heard about it. Marlon Brando gives an outstanding Oscar worthy performance, which earned him an Oscar to which he "refused." Al Pacino stars and gives stellar acting toward the film, and in my opinion this catapulted his movie career into stardom. Francis Ford Coppola directs phenomenally, and the film is as close to realism as you can get. Everything is tops from: the screenplay, the acting, cinematography, etc. You will not be disappointed; this film will forever stand the test of time.
I can say that this isn't just good movie, it's amazing, it's not just one of the best, it's the best movie I've ever seen. What an idea, what a music, what a brave of characters in this movie. I read book of Mario Puzo a year ago, all the movies in this trilogy I had seen for 3-4 years. Book is also great, but I definitely like movie much. Sometimes I compare it to "Once upon a time in America", there is such an idea I think, but greater is Godfather I mean. 10 stars out 10. I didn't give such a point to any movie... Still the best however I have seen about 100-150 movies. I don't think something will change for me in future so Godfather will be the greatest one for me.
I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but you've already knew it deep inside of you. IT ISN'T THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES !! Yeah, I agree, the story is complex, the acting is outstanding, but all in all it's a proper 8 out of 10.
A masterpiece. It's not just a gans movie, beyond of that.


This is the best movie ever. The directing is perfect, the actors are perfect (Marlon Brando, unforgetable acting)the story is beautiful. This movie is just perfect. The final scene is amazing.
A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.

Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of "family" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimised or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.

Best for ever.
I think this is one of the best mafia movies ever made. It has everything you can ask for: action, nice photography, great direction, suspense, and the best of all: a great plot.

I really wish they made movies like this nowadays. Today most of what you see in the cinemas is filled with special effects but the plot sucks big time. I hope Hollywood will change the way they make cinema today.

What other mafia movies are the big guys making today? none. Why? Because there is not enough money to support the script developers and everything goes into special effects. That sucks. Hope great movies like this will never die.
Science fiction has been used as an indication of what the future may hold. At times, it was promising a utopian future, where scientific inventions and developments will make life so much better for "humans", and machines (robots or, more generally, artificial intelligence) will be doing all the hard work. In other cases, however, it held a dystopian future, a warning message: technology can, and will, go wrong, and it will backfire, making our future full of destruction and agony.
well, after watching the trio for the first time , I could have figured out that I was living with a lack of understanding the human nature before. cruelty is coming from our very nature as well as the feeling of love, belonging, disloyalty and helplessness..we are the same mixture of those living in different shapes and names..It's impossible to divide ourselves from those elements and, whoever we are, this is the film of understanding that, power and wealth is only the carriage to us, can not be the aim itself..and also, happiness is always a prisoner of real life tragedies because of ýt's good nature..ýf human is in the way of managing those tragedies in stead of obeying them, impossible to get out from facing the harder ones..and the best is managing our own desires.. godfather is like a whole life for me, and it's a u turn in my life.I just can't understand that a human could write down it and another one put it on screen.. yasemin

I have always been a sucker for mafia movies and "Goodfellas" has always been my favorite but I now must change my mind. I have seen The Godfather now about ten times or so and the movie grows on me more each time I watch it. I pick up little things that I didn't notice every time and to me the movie gets better and better each time as well. The storyline changes so much and I hardly notice that it is three hours long. I would have to say that I don't think there will ever be a film that could ever come close to The Godfather. They just don't make them like they used to.
Film is a epic story about Corleone family. A realy good production, realy good performances. Actually Nino Rota's musics are amazing. In the film there are a real athmosphere. I think the film will be in cinemas soon.

This movie is the definition of masterpiece.

All the movies is something special but this on is the one that 9 from 10 viewers pick as their favourite.
This movie is one of the best ever made. Marlon Brando as its best beside -on the waterfront-. I've never seen a man playing a role like this. so realistic and authentic. He is for me the greatest actor of all time. a young Pacino or a Robert Duvall are terrific too. Family and Italian traditions are the main themes in this movie. even lessons about life you will in this movie. it shows the strength of a family.The American way of life.A dark history in the states are shown. The influence of criminal organizations to politics and the system are clear to see. you can put the whole movie plot to this time and it will still be effective . thats why the movie is so genius. A non true story film with true messages! strictly Art.
For me this is one movie I will never forget. Fantastic cast. AL PACINO showed how versatile an actor he is. He showed no fear. You become part of the story. I would recommend to anyone. Everytime I see it seems like the first time. Mr Coppola put a lot work into it.
Masterpiece movie I have introduced The Godfather trilogy to my two sons with 9 and 7 yrs old 8 years ago. in the beginning, they understood nothing but captured the main message: The father is a wise and respectable man. Nowadays, every time this movie is broadcasting at cable TVs or movie portals, both stopped what they are doing to watch saying the Marlon Brando scripts. My legacy was passed to them by these 3 movies. Marcos.

I just love it .. Amazing movie it can make you really fall in love with every single scene in the movie, and the actors did the best and can see how they really live in that moment . great work I've seen the movie many times and I am still enjoying it .. everyone who haven't watch it yet please go and watch it and enjoy it maybe you will tear up and it will make you smile . no man can live without a family no matter how old are you or how rich you are .. Always we need some friends around and our roots and family this is the pretty thing it can make human live in peace We will always love who take care of us and give us smile and protect us
A movie I enjoy over and over. It does justice to the book. Never boring and excellent acting.
If there is one way to run a business its like Don Vito Corleone there is no way to describe the sheer brilliance of this film i will never forget it as long as i live. Although he is no longer alive Marlon Brando is in my book one of the greatest actors. I don't recall blinking once through the whole movie and although the movie is a little cheese in the visual effects it becomes timeless by having such a classic setting like the 1940's new york. Thing i loved best was the characters and how they each changed through out the film although the time span was skewed so as to not be able to tell how much time had gone by the way the characters acted was enough of a clue to show vast amounts of change in time and life. I loved this movie for many reasons but when i grow up i wanna be like Mikey Corleone
Inspired by the novel by Mario Puzo, the film is a grand story of Don Vito Corleone, a Sicilian mobster, got the head of a major mafia networks in America. The film shows a very realistic view of the world where the word given less accessible and promises have a capital value and honor is the highest price. Unfortunately for him, when his life is in danger, his children can not stay away from danger, and they are trained in this highly risky game of battles between mafia clans in America. Respect, murder, money and, above all, power: these are the words that best define this film and its action. Probably the best movie ever. Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, it's the perfect actor for the role. The storyline is as good, and the whole cast has done its job and actors including Duval, De Niro and Al Pacino. Not very often blends so well a movie.
the godfather is the best movie i had ever seen.I don't know how many times i watch this movie,maybe 20 or more. I think all the film lovers must see the film. Marlon Brando was excellent as godfather,but i like Alpacino most. His transformation from civilian to underworld don was terrific,and i cant imagine anybody else in the role of Michael. I don't know why he did not awarded an academy award for his portrayal of Michael . That's why i don't like academy awards. Tom Hagen is also very good. I liked the way Coppola directed it,as a lengthy movie i never get bored. I also watched THE GODFATHER part2, also a great movie and THE GODFATHER part3,which was not so bad as many says. Undoubtedly THE GODFATHER part1 is my best movie and i will never stop watching it.
This is the drama about an Italian family with a serious influence to the society and contributed a large part to the crime wave in the 1930's. The movie also talk about the family value and how they stick together in any situation Don Vito Corleone, head of the family, who had build up his own mob empire. He dealt in pretty much anything,from drug to robberies. He had some serious pull in the US government. Politicians eat out of his hand like birds. He was one of the most powerful men at that time until he got shot by one of his rivals. Thats when Michael, his son, comes into play.

Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, World War I hero, after the military, he went home to stay with the family. After his father got shot, he took the liberty to protect the family service by killing a corrupted cops along with his partner who happens to be Vito's rival and shooter. Michael did just that and he had to move out of the country for a while until the heat is off of him. He returns several years after and took over the family.
A perfect combination of a traditional Italian familiy mixed with mafian and underground crimes. One of the movies you watch and understand the plot, but conclusions and story are changing days after.
If you want to learn leadership you have to watch this movie.


This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
A perfect gem in the movie history, a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The Godfather portrays inner world of the Italian mafia - there are no fancy moments, no glittering hysterics of gangsters it shines from the creeks of the kitchen and dining room, impressive performances, timeless lighting and engrossing editing makes this a masterpiece, A must watch for all the movie buffs.
The best gengster films of all time. -great characters -good atmosfera -exciting story
This movie was impeccable. It showed great cinematography, and the acting was superb. The suspense was carried throughout the film with heart beating, wrenching music that matched beautifully with the scene's setting. The character of Don Corleone makes the audience feel less than him due to his superiority he portrays in the film. I highly recommend this movie to everybody, even if you do not enjoy mafia movies. The reason why it did not receive a 10 is due to the duration of the film's storyline. I just felt it ran a little too slow for my taste, but besides that, it is an amazing film comprised with outstanding performances in all film aspects.
An amazing drama. This kind of movies are made once every 100 years. An absolute masterpiece.
Kesin seyredilmesi gereken bir film. Siddetle tavsiye ediyorum. Seri halinde 3 film 10 saatten fazla sürüyor. You must watch this film. Extremly advice.
Actually,there are few words left for me to comment on and praise the first film of the godfather trilogy.As a person who read Mario Puzo's best-seller novel, I can tell that the story is perfectly put into the movie scenario with all the scenes having grave importance.Secondly,all characters of the film,including side roles as well as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino perform a tremendous play.For example James Caan(one of my favourite actors), aka Sonny , fits very well with all his manners,looks the quicktempered, hot casanova mafia image.Besides these, the scenario is realistic and dramatic in terms of an inside picture of an Italian mafia family with all the cosa nostra traditions of 40's and before.This movie has created its mottos(an offer you can't refuse) , stable characters(I even do not have the right to criticize Marlon Brando and Al Pacino) and unforgettable scenes.With this property this movie is the pioneer of all the other mafia tragedies and dramas.
One of the best gangster movies that have been released.Some people say this it the only good one in the trilogy but I disagree with that statement, although it is the best one. The story and acting are superb. Hell, Marlon Brando as The Godfather is a reason enough to watch this film. It really feels as Coppola had some inside informant give him insight on how things work in a mafia family. They are many other crime movies but in my opinions none of those is on the same level as "The Godfather"(that's not saying they are bad or of inferior quality of course).

I recommend seeing this movie to anyone, enjoys not only crime flicks but good cinema in general.
Great story, great movie, love every bits of the movie.

Marlon Brando is a great character.

Personally, i think this is the best part of 3 parts.

Storyline is very well written, slow when it need to be slow and fast when it got to be fast.
Although not my favorite film of all time this ranks up there pretty close to the top of the pile. The cast alone is enough to make you shake at the thought of watching it. This brutal film is also funny and clever. It has bullies, cold calculating killers, bent cops, one or two nice guys, a plethera of wise guys and the dismembered head of a dead race horse thrown in (to bed) for good measure.

Only 8.5 out of 10 for me i'm afraid; I feel that it went on a tad too long. I believe that most films should only last for 2 hours max. Although I must confess in this case this movie could just be better than most?!

Any longer than 2 hours and I would feel like I was showing off if I were a film maker if you know what I mean?? It's only my opinion though :)
I'm not too good at elaboration, so I'll keep this short and sweet - The Godfather is quite simply the greatest film ever made. Superb cast, superb acting, superb filming, superb directing, superb story...if you watch this film your life will be bettered. Al Pacino's career best performance, Marlon Brando's career best performance, and superb supporting turns from James Caan, Robert Duvall et al ensure that Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film will forever go down as a classic, the greatest film ever. Based on the classic novel "The Godfather" by Mario Puzo. I advise that you read that - it's absolutely fantastic, and the film stays nigh on 100% faithful to the novel. Go watch. Now.
Classic movie with classic actors in which it cannot be missed. A movie that I grew up with and your children and grandchildren will as well. Not many movies are made in this way. Some try to replicate, but it cannot be done. A timeless classic that does not go out of style. A movie that may not be for the whole family, but eventually will.
Alucinante, me he quedado estupefacto, boquiabierto, patidifuso, anonadado.
Probably the best movie about criminal world, which shows all sides of people life who are involved and how their life is changed by very powerful force. And the movie about the young man who saves not his real family but also people who are even closer... The Plot makes a huge effect on viewers feelings and emotions while characters battle between life and death. This is probably the best performance of Pacino and Brando. In my opinion everyone who sees this movie will absolutely say it is good and will understand waht godfather means. Power not only makes people to fear the don but love as well, because that power if is used well it effects life in many different ways: help, destroy, make cry or smile and understand the true values of family and close friends.
The truly amazing performance by Marlon Brando as the ageing mob-boss Vito Corleone is not the only stroke of brilliance in this film. The performance by the then young Al Pacino as the youngest son Micheal was also first class. His portrayal as a young man, recently out of the army, who was determined to stay well out of his fathers business but through a series of events transformed is quite stunning. Far greater than part two and one of the best films ever made. Supported by great performances by Robert Duvall as the families adopted son and lawyer Tom Hagen and James Caan as Vito's psychotic eldest son Sonny, Brando's portrayal comes believingly to life in this fantastic film.
The film of the film, before the ephemeral production, technical marvel (the assembly that the godson of baptism, intersperses the prayer of Michael Corleone with the murders of which he is principal, the exceptional photography, which explores the shadow business of mafia and the light in Michael's relationship with Apollonia, pure and virginal), the force of the cast, the script that interweaves family intrigues with the struggle for power, and the perfection with which Coppola enacts its history. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are memorable, the first as the patriarch who does everything for the family, the second as the odd one who denies the Father and gradually gets involved by the mafia, even to realize that most of the time, the powerful is alone.
When I see the scenes on this film. Its always expressing something...
The Godfather is the Godfather of movies too. Many may like it others may not perhaps understand it for the first time they watch it. They need to re-watch perhaps. Anyways, This movie is intense in acting, severe in direction and watchable in any point of time. Even after 4 decades, the movie maintains its slot in first 5 of IMDb top 250. The opening line:"I believe in America" to the very end keeps you entertaining SLOWLY and STEADILY. For those who understand mafia, underworlds and gaming zones of elites, they can understand this movie. Marlon Brando is supreme as DON. The duologue's are perfect and the cinematography is plausible.

Recommended for all freaks. Those who do not enjoy it watching for the first time may re watch and their concepts may vary. Well performed Brando and Pacino.
I still watch this movie until this day will always love this movie.
This is my first review. It is an excellent and very well done movie There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This is one of my all time favorite. This movie stands at the top in all decades. "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now.
Coppola's 1972 film "The Godfather" is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece. No other film to date has combined violence, romance and music so seamlessly. From the intertwining plot-lines to the flawless and complex character developments, everything about "the Godfather" was pure viewing magic. Never before, nor since, have I seen a film of such grandeur and class.

The Mafia's habits are portrayed in meticulous detail - brutality towards rivals, but generosity within "the family". Marlon Brando's performance as "Don Corleone" and Al Pacino's as his son "Michael" are outstanding, and provide the film with sheer star quality. "The Godfather" is without doubt the best movie ever made, and deserves all the accolades it receives, plus some.

Twenty out of ten.
I was a kid before I watch this movie (12 yrs old) then I became a filmeater.
I have to admit that although I have not had any information about the subject for many years, I would think that it would be a heavy future, and that I would face the film and such a thing. I do not think that it is such an exaggerated script, the impressive aspect of Filmin is not it. It was all over it. It was a great story that Michael, like Michael, turned himself into a character who could not feel his family's way of life, and that he had become his father over time. Brando's character was a legend in itself. If you're still watching, do not waste any time.I did not see such a heavy character. I regret that I watched too late. The work of the family was very well done. The tones of the auditions were all legendary. It was the most beautiful film I've ever seen in my life.
Brilliant composition, between casts director and writer. Very intense and deep dialogue, most of them are quoted with so many people throughout time. Classic movie that everyone should watch. The characters gave their best performance in this movie, I'm fully concentrated in every minutes. Especially, Marlon Brando. This would be Marlon Brando's greatest performance as The Godfather, and I think no one could beat that unique accent of his. This makes him one of the most influential actors of all time. Although a little bigger role from Tom Hagen would be nice, just like in the novel. Definitely one of the greatest classic movies of all time!

This feature is one of the best! i watched a lot and it is still my favored one. i have to give two thumbs up for the actors and director. my dream is to be able to work on it, if only i was there with the crew preparing sets and interacting with them actors, high people. To me, this film pictured the actual contraband and mafia rules that reigned in the time.
A world-class film from world-class novel with world-class actors.
The Godfather is a masterpiece. The actors are fantastic,(Pacino and Brando in particular), it is well-written and masterfully directed. It probably has more famous lines than any other movie. Every day on T.V. you see something imitating the Godfather. While a lot of people would argue that it doesn't deserve it's #1 ranking, can you think of a better movie? I think the scene in this movie that best explains why this is an excellent movie from every angle is the baptism scene. While all this murder and brutality is going on around him, Michael Corleone is standing godfather to his sister's child. The music is great and you you finally understand what the title of this movie really means.
This movie should be watched thanks to its reality that is surrounding around people's life. İt is very successful that mafia family, relating departments and citizens which are shown as reality facts in time condition of 1900s. İt is the most important point of the Godfather movie that people which are related closely with movie and novel, is successfully combined. Before you watched a movie, they should read Mario Puzzo's novel so you can exactly improve movie information. We can say that the most successful adaptation movie in Hollywood movie sector. Especially, when we look at the daily movie, we can exactly see the Godfather's importance and affects. I assume that this movie series affect all movie sector which are consist of actor, actress, screenplay, editor etc... I want to give an importance that the reality factor of this movie. We can not find the reality factor on daily movie because of the fact that computer science and using improved in movies.
The character played by Marlon Brando (Don) is incomparable with any other actor in this movie. Also the outline of the movie is fantastic. The story keeps on going and you never feel bored or non interesting scenes. The dialogues are very powerful. "I'ill make him an offer he can't refuse". The roles of Tom Hagen, Sonny and of course Michael (Al Pachino) are epic and very heart touching. The sound & music gives us a feel like Italian environment in USA. At the start you may feel a slow moving film, but as the time elapses the best of the acting, directing and dialogues comes on the surface. At the last its a must watch movie at least twice in your lifetime.
One of the best master piece by "Francis Ford Coppola", Desevrs the best Rating ever. It gives Marlon Brando the new name. Al Pacino as his best. Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando, whose iconic performance has overshadowed an even better turn by Al Pacino as his son Michael) is a man for whom family is all. "A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man," he says, and he lives by that. He's devoted to his wife, dotes on his children and grandchildren, throws a lavish wedding for his daughter, and kills or threatens anyone who gets in his way or that of his family and friends. His sons are all in the family business, which includes union racketeering and gambling.
The film is a must see, anyone who has not yet seen it is missing out on the true beauty of film making. This film has deserved all of the awards it received. Marlon Brando plays an excellent role as Don Vito Corleone, and along with Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. They both fit their parts perfectly! The first time I saw it I was blown away by the acting. Marlon Brando especially, his character's voice really makes him unique and fun to watch. Al Pacino is a war hero and the youngest son of three, he comes home for his sister Connie's wedding. And the godfather's daughter's wedding day is the most important to him. Like said, this movie is a must see and I highly encourage everyone who has not seen it to see it as soon as possible, classic movies like these never get old.
The best classic movie ever.. To truly get the best affect of this movie you have to see it more than once. (I have only seen this once but I promise you I will see it again)
Forever one of my all time favorites... Top 10 movies in my library. Michael Corleone: Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to a personal services contract with this big-band leader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it. But the band leader wouldn't let him. Now, Johnny is my father's godson. So my father went to see this bandleader and offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no. So the next day, my father went back, only this time with Luca Brasi. Within an hour, he had a signed release for a certified check of $1000. Kay Adams: How did he do that? Michael Corleone: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay Adams: What was that? Michael Corleone: Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract....... Thats a true story. Michael Corleone: Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract. Thats a true story.
Best movie i've ever saw in my life. I was in school where my schoolmates told me about this movie and i was so excited to see what is about it and when i get home i watch it online and was the best experience in my life. Hope these guys will make more parts because this move was excellent.
One of the greatest films that I have watched in my life
Best movie ever. I never get wearing of this movie.
The Godfather show us that a good movie remains forever a good movie. We should see all the little parts and all the sub-meanings that this movie brings. The cast is exceptional and Marlon Brando (may God have mercy of his soul) plays in a way that words can't describe it. Just watch the movie and enjoy it. It's the best movie ever! The Godfather II and III were only good, not exceptional like the first part. This is a once in a lifetime movie and it must be understood. I've read all sorts of articles and declarations of the actors, i know all the story of making the movie and that information, beside watching the movie convinced me that The Godfather will remain one of the best movies of the history. It should get more Oscars.
Marvelous, no words. The director, the cinematography were perfect. The best film.
There have been numerous Crime/Drama films that chronicle the lives of a Mafia family or certain outcast 'wiseguys', but none of them leave an impression as deep as the one left by The Godfather. That is because The GF isn't JUST a crime/drama, it rises above a genre, it's about family. The transformation of Michael Corleone is one of the greatest character stories in cinema history, from the reluctant family outsider to the ruthless mafia boss, about how the least involved son is forced to take over his fathers' empire. The intricacies in the storytelling, the twists in the plot get you every time. It makes these thugs seem not like dim-witted robbers, but suit-clad businessmen. This movie has managed to start up a legacy, a cult. The sheer power of it leaves one speechless and spellbound and perhaps that is why it is the greatest that celluloid has to offer.
GQ Magazine once had a cover story saying "why can't more women look like Gyeneth Paltrow". I say why can't more film's be like The Godfather. The film that revatalised Marlon Brando's career and set Al Pacino and Robert Duvall on two of the most successful film career's ever.In terms of atmosphere it has yielded on of the greatest scenes in cinematic and atmospheric history. I am of course referring to the scene in Lou's Diner (which was, sadly, recentely torn down). Channel 4 (UK) ran a poll of the "100 greatest movies ever". The Godfather was second to some film about Mark Hamill and a beam sword. In my clearly unbiassed opinion The Best Film Ever
This is the only movie i come back to watch again and again. Defines the word masterclass for me. Gem of a film. It becomes the bar to compare other films to.
The movie is powerful, strong, good casting, good talkings, it's hard to find a defect here. You can watch and re-watch and does not get boring. There's nothing else to say than: go and watch if you haven't watched yet.
well... what do you really want a movie to be? did you ever ask yourself that? If somebody gave you all the power to produce a movie... what would you do? a movie ... of course... but this is NOT a movie. reality is not something that you can create at your free will. the hardest part in art is to (at least) try to express reality. But you will only express it as YOU see it... I think this is one of those artistic accomplishments that came very very close to what everybody sees. that's art. And thanks to Al Pacino & Marlon Brando ! anybody who even questions these actors... should think twice before. I'm proud to be a contemporary with Al Pacino ! thank you
God Father with all parts is really the Only and excellent movie of all the time about tough criminal world. It is one those movies when no matter of the part of the movie characters stay the same - that makes it like One Big Pciture. It's the one you gonna watch over and over, repeating the best moments.The film's famous score was composed by Nino Rota. Francis Coppola's father Carmine Coppola contributed to the music performed in the film's wedding scene.[28] Later, his son would call on him to compose additional music for the score of The Godfather Part II (1974) and most of the score for The Godfather Part III (1990) Love this movie!

Wonderful movie. It made me feel special just from the first minute till the end. After movie I wondered if I can do something like these guys did - thefts, kidnappings and all that kind of dirty stuff. The film perfectly conveys the atmosphere - dark and ominous New York, and a sunny, but mysterious Italy. Top rated move.
A True Master pieces from Francis Ford Coppola, and both Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were at their best in acting. Dialogue Delivery is very awesome, one can watch this movie n number of times and never get bored.
Well, I just wanted to remark on the Sicily scenes. They were superb! Coppola could not have painted a better portrait of the community life in Sicily on those days. I feel I can tell better because I live in Malta, a small island just beneath Sicily which till the late 1970s still had a lifestyle almost identical to that of the Sicilians. The attire, the environment (the fields, the terraced walls, the type of plants), the surroundings, the wine bars, the facial characteristics of the people were very much similar to those of the Maltese people and in some places it is still very similar to that. And this culminates in the wedding celebrations.

Finally, this led me to grasp the difference between the convolution of American lifestyle and the simplicity of the Sicilian lifestyle, even though there were some perceptible parallels.
This is not just movie, it is an emotion. The dialouges are very comfortable the acting level is incomparable.


I think that Godfather 1 is the best movie ever made. Along side Enemy at the gates, The good The bad and The ugly, Popillon,The Message  is one of the outstanding movies, but I can say that godfather 1 is the best. It is my opinion that there are more than 10 sequences in this fabulous movie that we can rate them as the best sequences in history of cinema.

I think that story is fantastic; Marlon Brando is incredible, and all the actors and actresses are great. The ending is dramatic and music is also one of the best one. I often see the top sequences for 1 to 60 minutes. I really congratulate to Francis Ford Coppola for this excellent movie. YOU TAPE YOUR NAME IN HISTORY DEAR FRANCIS.
Firstly I want to apologize about my writing skill in English. Seriously, this movie was the best movies that ever been made by human. This movie will bring you to a terrific drama about family live. The storyline of this movie will amuse you. You will be brought into the movie as a main character. This movie also invite the viewers to play and think as a mafia. The Godfather also teach us about honor, loyalty, and respect. These are the main idea of this movie. Al Pacino's performance really added something to this movie. But don't you ever forget about the wise Marlon Brando performance guys. Marlon and Al really got into the movie, they acted like they are a real mafia on the real life. I can't tell you a better movies than The Godfather. If you never watch this movie, you better watch it now ! The word that close to describe The Godfather is FANTASTIC.

The best movie I have ever seen in my life!

Great actors, great scenes and plot. I haven't read the book but I am planning to. A must see if you haven't!

It's one of the unique movies. It's not just a crime, mafia movie but it has lots of emotional moments as well. And for me it portrays the love in a family so good. And musics in this movie are just wonderful. I have the soundtracks in my phone and I love to listen them.



The greatest mafia movie ever. With brilliant playing by specially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this film reveals how one among the mind mafia families in Ny works, it gives a comprehensive image of how their company runs and what sort an opportunities they got to take on their company.

Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.

The Godfather has all the qualities of a great film. Everything in it is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola has done a marvelous job in directing. The cast is superb especially the Oscar-winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting is phenomenal. It has the many of the greatest movie quotes of all time. It shows the humane side of Mafia and depicts it so beautifully that we are absorbed by it. It has immortalized Mario Puzo's novel. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is also the most entertaining film. It is a magnificent portrayal of organized crime. The themes of the movie are sublime. It induces us to empathize with criminals. It is a timeless masterpiece and an exemplary film.
Very good movie and very very fun and very very very old is gudfadern and basiclly a very good family movie to watch on a friday night with some popcorn and with big family!!!!!!!
One of the best 10 movies of all times and it's really amazing work.. It is here that writers Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque fair considerably better. The Palmer family's back story is well thought-out and moving, effectively allowing us to understand.

If only there was slightly less story. Director David Dobkin ("Wedding Crashers," "Fred Claus") is so consumed with Hank's myriad issues – and there are many more than what's included here – that the run time bloats to 141 minutes, which is too much for its own good. Still, Dobkin succeeds in showcasing his best asset – the ensemble – by staying out of the actors' way and allowing the material to speak for itself. It may not always work in terms of structure, tone and expedience, but it works often enough to be a solid drama.
Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen! The First time I watched this film was when I was a kid, probably about 8, and I feel in love with this type of film making.
Very good movie, the actors have a lot of potential. Keep it up, guys!
This movie really did change my life. It was absolutely breathtaking and so complete in film quality. I have never seen so flimed and completed so well and there was a near perfect movie of that type, it would be the Godfather. You look at the cast of people in this movie and these people were made stars because of this movie or already were stars; Al Pacino,James Caan, Marlon Brando, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and the list goes on. The storyline was unbelievable with a plot that was constantly evolving and the commitment to accuracy and staying true to Puzo's novel written years earlier. People actually spoke Italian in this movie and you really felt that they were their characters because they sold it to you that well. I still look at Brando, Caan and Pacino and say, "Your the Godfather who started it all, your Sonny with rage and ferocity and Pacino is the up and coming Godfather who is the most sinister and clever Godfather there ever was."
This movie is the greatest film of all time, so gripping you can watch it over and over, it's long and you won't get bored, at anytime.

I've watched this movie so many times I can give only a average of over 100 times I have see it, from the characters to sets, oh and the screen play is magnificent. Great movie ever made, mind you I don't like remakes but if they do please be sure to not destroy a classic. Thank you to all.
"The Godfather" is much more than a story about gangsters and based on the novel by Mario Puzo mob. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful in the art of film and endowed with a classical virtuosity inspired, serves up the organization and the intrigues of the crime society to conceive of a true epic about family and about the evolution of family values during the twentieth century. Incidentally, "The Godfather" is perhaps the first major cinematic chronicle of the twentieth century on the family's own twentieth century. It is a kind of self-analysis; an exercise that the time has come to prove as extraordinary.Just simple saying... watch the movie... one of the best ever produce...
This movie is so epic. One of the best movies in the universe, that's for sure, worth watching for everyone. The actors are great, casting is great and plot blows your mind. Unbelievable experience. It's amazing that 40 years later it still holds up. It brings out different emotions. And Al Pacino is a wonderful actor. The Godfather is fantastic from start to finish, there isn't a single second that felt off to me. It runs for almost 3 whole hours, and each second is utter perfection. It's a testament to the strength of the screenplay when you can sit in one spot and watch the film for twice the length of most feature films and be totally riveted and enthralled the whole time. This is a long, long movie, but not a single instant is wasted.
This movie is one of the milestones of movie industry and one that considered a real art from all aspects. it is a must for any person and will be for the coming 50 years at least, The cast, writer, producer and director, all did a perfect job, resulting in this master piece of a movie. I recommend this for any one with all three parts, without any hesitation.
Old cult cinema. Great movie. Some movies you just have to see. Although the production is young, it really keeps you in suspense. You could do it with little effort cool movie in the seventies. It is known that there were so many sound effects and light but there feel the atmosphere of American cinema. May passion for cinema is one of the two because the first is a medical emergency, major who is studying for two years. I hope that in the future I will be able to help people and work in a close-knit team of people who have a passion for what they do. Certainly, however, will not give up keeping abreast of what goes on the screen. Only in recent films miss the message. The focus is to contract the most popular actor. Increasingly, however, are valued directors who are not afraid to make difficult subjects, it can sometimes controversial. I like the cinema.

All the fan of the godfather trilogy got it wrong. This is not a story about the mafia or gangster or tough guys. This is a story about family. This a story about a youngest son of the family taking things in his own hand so that he can take care of his family. For that , he will do anything that is necessary.
Big film art, amazing film and the history. Photography scenes pretty cool and darkness areas of the film is that I liked very much.


You can't comment that the Godfather is a bad movie if you haven't seen all three. The "first movie" is actually the first part of a three movie story. It isn't three separate movies; it's three parts of one story. The third movie sums it all up. If you say you don't like the Godfather, watch the second and third parts and then comment. You cannot intelligently comment on a story that you haven't heard all of.

And if you think the movie is boring, why did the book sell so well? Why has the movie endured for so long? The story must be a good one. If you don't like it, chances are you just don't get it. The movie isn't about a mafia family. It's about the life of one man (Michael Corleone) and his personal struggles with what he has done and what he believes he is forced to do to protect his family.
Magnificent saga, magnificent direction, still a masterpiece, me and my family get together and watch it every year again and again!!! Coppola is one of the smartest directors of our era.
This is the movie that introduced me to my adulthood. At 19 years old, when I first seen The Godfather Trillogy back in 2013, I was enlightened to what film making was all about. In my own words, film is created to mirror society and to broaden your experiences while living on this earth through the moving motion pictures. What I experienced through this film was how to respect family morals, different contrast to business behavior, and most importantly how to discern who to trust. This film tells a thorough storyline from beginning to end. It's not just a mobster movie, but a family and business movie as well that journey's you through the never ending trials and tribulations that can come with working with a family business. If you haven't seen this franchise yet, don't let me spoil it for you, you can watch it for yourself.
My favorite movie ,best actors ever. This is the kind of movies that must be in your libraries

this is the best film for me ! i didn't see film like this ! i hope all see this film before die ! this film make me love movies ! in the paste i didn't love movies like this .. but with this film it make me adore fir movies ! i hope in future we will see some movies like this movie ! we miss movies like this ! when i see this movie i know what mafia mean .. and there is people in mafia have heart and rules and respect ! in the paste i think mafia just people didn't have heart or anything like human .. but this movie change some ideas for me .. i love movies because it's change my mind to the best ! my mind is open now and this movie open my mind for movies cinemas TV shows everything !
In a scene where Marlon Brando should look angry, she's a masterpiece that allows us to see how wonderful an actor she is by bending her vein on her forehead at her own will.
This is one of the best movies I have EVER!! seen. The depth of characters. The drama. The griping story. Everything is just perfect. Pacing of this movie is a bit slow at times but it's needed to build up to something bigger if you know what I mean. And the soundtrack? Beautiful music which fits perfectly for the movie. Nino Rota did a great job. Marlon Brando as godfather was the best casting for the role ever! He just showed how acting should be done. Again one the well made and perfectly crafted movies ever. If you haven't seen this. You are really missing out! Go ahead and watch it right now! You will not be disappointed.

Then you probably will love it :) I'm not a fan, not my type of movie.
Although I am not a movie buff but one thing I must say out of the experience I've gained over the past few years of movie watching is that this movie is a masterpiece. Great Direction. Flawless acting. Entertaining & thrilling moments. In short a great movie. Easily the best crime drama I have seen. Loved watching every moment of it. Marlon Brando is easily at his best in this movie. Along with several other actors. A must watch for all movie buffs. Especially the fans of crime drama genre. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right.
This is the second best movie i have ever seen in my life. People knew that back in the 70's and still today it is unmatched in quality and realism. The length of the movie was perfectly acceptable otherwise we would never get the whole story. Anyone (and i mean anyone) who gives this movie lower than 5 should be watching boo-dome and should be banned from any movie rating sites. Worth to watching. What can I say. Only Aliens was better movie for me. It is hard to find word to describe that movie. There no mistakes in Godfaher. Whole movie is brilliant. Long epic movie about crime, love, power and other stuff. If you don't watch this, do it as quickly as possible.
This is the best movie in the history of film making, a good mix movie and its hard to watch that mix again
A masterpiece of cinema Marlon Brando emerged from the darkness and oblivion in the most memorable role of his career. Al Pacino reflected as anyone how they had to accept the dark side so much wanted to avoid. The rest of the cast does not make you shade. An intense James Caan, Robert Duvall one phlegmatic and John Cazale who suffered the emotions of her character, been forgotten by his family but that power ends up changing it. An intense story, second to none. The rest of the cast does not make you shade. An intense James Caan, Robert Duvall one phlegmatic and John Cazale who suffered the emotions of her character, been forgotten by his family but that power ends up changing it. The beautiful landscapes of Italy, gang wars and violence and cruelty of power are ingredients that brighten
I watched it when I was 13 years old. No one asked me to do so. I loved it and kept watching it for 30 times in 30 days. I have a top ten list, The Godfather 1972 is out of the list. On the top. Nothing can come close to it.
Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.

The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia.
Great Movie! It shows the life of a true Mafioso, a true Italian man! Anybody that ha sent watch this movie need to! Its just too good! The way the movie is set up, how the family is always first, is just so true. Im Argentine, of Italian descent, and it shows how Italians are, always the family, and you never mess with the family. It shows how the early years of the US Mafia was, even thought this is not based on a true story, it does show how the Mafia was. For those who have not seen this movie and are not sure if they should watch it, i say do it, you truly wont regret it, you will get involve in the movie so fast, and it has so many legendary actors, nothing wrong with this movie, it is one of the greatest movie of all time!
I watched this for the first time when I was very young loved it then & still love it. to waste time i'll talk about love i had a girlfriend resonantly that i thought i loved but actually i just needed somebody at the time she talked about so many things i didn't really care about, at her ugly day i thought she was really ugly & to me those are two signs that tell you when you you love or don't love someone because like in the movie here was love and hate & so on, I know this because the son liked the girl when she was at her ugliest & cared about what she talked about....... Godfather puts an orange peel in his mouth at the end.
This movies are very dark i think. Stories are telling family relationships. Sometimes very hard sometimes inside with love. But at least you understand , men and woman are very different . İf You want to see men force you have to see this movie. İ Feld angry and depressed after watched this trilogy. Movie has telling every little word or every looking have meaning.

If you decide wrong decision it can be killed you. Families are important, relationships have to be meaningful and, who have the power and strong he will survive.

And the little note , my father has to dubbing this film on Turkey:)

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.

For me this movie best movie i see it .
The best movie ever made... I think Francis Ford Coppolla's Godfather is best in all ways of directing,acting,musical,cinematographic... Although it tells a story of everything; i mean so many characters you see in movie and different emotions from all type you feel doesn't make you away from story.You become part of this life told in movie.

That is a very serious movie about serious things and be sure i am serious too about;Godfather is best!

Another point is the year that film is made.35 years before,making this movie.Just like a dream.

Mario Puzo , writer of the book is a genius who wrote Superman.
This movie is brilliant. The acting, the well thought out scenes, the actions. Its all here and its made for a great classic which has stood the test of time after 30+ years! Al Pacino is awesome as is Marlon Brando. The ruthless streak to Pacino is horrifyingly chilling and is brilliantly acted. It deserves to be at number one because it is that good! My favourite movie of all time with some classic quotes! The way Coppola shows loyalty, respect and not playing by the rules are all shown and this makes for great viewing. Pacino's best film in my opinion!

"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!"

"You come to me with this one favour but you show no respect"

"I love America"
Oh Dear Lord, where to start... Watched it again yesterday and decided to give it a review. This movie is pure excellence from Francis Ford Coppola. Great script, marvelous acting, superb cast and over the top directing. Brando as Vito Corleone is simply remarkable and the progression of Michael Corleone (Pacino) is just impressive. Great work from both actors. It is hard that there would ever be something close to The Godfather. Everything that needs to be in a movie piece, The Godfather has it. Relationships, family, real life, loyalty and greed made this movie something worth the attention. All mixed up with an artistic touch made it a number one classic for me. Hats off to you Mr. Coppola, definitely a must see.
i saw more gangster movie but all are based on this movie. himself is not even the central character in the drama. he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II
This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in "The Godfather".
Lets talks about the godfather. Now i know what everyone is thinking, 27 nominations and 23 was won. Very accomplished movie to say the least but that's not what makes it a great movie. What makes it a great movie is that it is timeless! It exceeds every expectation that was brought upon it. Now i know about 90 percent of IMDb users will say " of course it's a great, what is there not to like about it. Well this movie does have a few flaws, not a lot but a few! But overall a fantastic piece of art. I've always wanted to create a movie that was visual as much as the godfather was or is. It really jumped Hollywood into a new era where mob movies were a thing and you could totally take risk with your story development and other things as well. I think it's fair to say that this movie has probably inspired a lot of directors in the film industry or better known as "Hollywood". I'm not a screen writer so don't get on me to bad for my spelling at times in this review.
I really watch every single movie in the top 250, and a lot more in all my life, but there is nothing close to The Godfather I and II, also Part III is a great ending to this trilogy. This movie is just the best, the characters and performances, the direction, writing, the amazing and classic scenes, everything is at the top of cinema history. I would love to erase this movie from my mind to experience this ride again. This is for sure, a MUST WATCH.
Truly, a flawless masterpiece; and quite possibly, ranking with Citizen Kane, the best movie of all time. I've seen this movie at least 20 times, and feel the need to watch it every six months (along with Godfather Part II...compared to the first two, Godfather Part III is lousy). The cast is simply incredible, particularly Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden, and the actors playing Jack Woltz and Luca Brazi.

Best scene: Vito Corleone (Brando) grabbing Johnny Fontane, when the latter tears-up, sniffling, "Oh Godfather, I don't know what to do; I don't know what to do--SNIFF". To which Vito grabs Johnny, slaps him in the face, and screams, "YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN!!!! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!!!? IS THIS WHAT YOU LEARN IN Hollywood???!! HOW TO CRY LIKE A WOMAN??? (mockingly) UHHHECHHEUHH!!! GODFATHER WHAT COULD I DO, WHAT COULD I DO??! What is this nonsense?"


Took me 33 years of my life to watch this and I now understand why it's rated as an all-time classic.

Amazing performances from Brando and Pacino, this gritty mob movie feels authentic and tells a captivating story of a famous mob family in transition.

The casting is spot on and the way the film makers feel like you're in the family seeing this all unfold make this instantly one of my favourites.
It's just awesome. Can't stop to repeat to watch this movie. THE BEST MOVIE! ALL TIME!!It's just awesome. Can't stop to repeat to watch this movie. THE BEST MOVIE! ALL TIME!!It's just awesome.

In 1972, one based on a bestselling film written by Mario Puzo emerged. The saga of the Corleone family is like a tragic opera, soaked in blood and deafened by the noise of the guns. The shooting marked by disagreements between the director and producers. A film that addresses violence, mafia, family and love. Yes, the love a father has for his family. Cynical characters under a humanized view maintains the essence of the work, no one is who is by chance, are the circumstances that define their choices, all for a greater good: the good of the family. A metaphor for America in the history of The Godfather is clear from the first moment, Francis Ford Coppola holds a dramatic power of passages of the book by Mario Puzo turning a great book into a powerful film, both in its aesthetics and in its essence. The Godfather is my favorite movie, and undoubtedly one of the most important films in history. The most talked about, imitated and revered film.
Godfather is awesome. It is one of the movies which inspired me to give time to my family. As the Godfather has said, "a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real men", this movie made me think that family is so important. No matter what is your business, you must spend time with your family. And don't even ask me about the acting. Marlon Brando is really a Godfather. His acting was one of the best of all times. And this movie is the reason that I started watching Al Pacino's movies. He is the greatest actor I have ever seen. He is a legend. And the way he acted in all parts of Godfather, I don't have any words to praise him. He is the Godfather of Hollywood.
(Short overall review) I watched "The Godfather" in 2013. It was broadcast Sunday evening at 20:00 and the sequel and prequel followed after one week each. At the time, my most favorite movie was only one. Even though I had watched numerous classics and modern films (Lord of the rings, Starwars, etc) I could only say "This is my favorite movie" to one production. But after I watched "The Godfather" the number increased. To say anything bad for this film will be an abomination. I have given several 10s in IMDb, to films I like, but I have always realized that if this was an official review I couldn't give 10 to any of them. That is not true for this one. This film truly deserves a 10 and will remain on the top of my list of the greatest movies of all time.
As for what I consider to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen
It's the Mona Lisa of the films and cult film that never will be old. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino adopt their role and they've contributed to the art to the that cinema era.
The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world that's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie.
This movie really broke the ice on mafia movies loved ever second of it. Power house cast cant stop watching. I hope to one day play in a classic like this and I'm sure I will. So many moments i couldn't move just had to sit eyes clued to TV. Epic movie. I can watch it a million times and not get tired.
The Godfather is the pinnacle of cinematic art. In no other film have I seen an equivalence in any general aspect of the film. This is special considering how extremely picky I am in terms of movies, but if I would have the opportunity to change this film, I would not. I consider The Godfather to be a single film, not three separate ones. the reason I have so much respect for this particular film is because it encompasses all the values I find most important in life; trust, honor, family and culture. Those are the four that I value completely. This film represents such emotion that I cannot begin to describe how I feel about it now. Plus, most of my favorite actors are in this film; Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, etc...
Movies don't get better than that and its been 50 years since that movie. The best production ever made. Marlon Brando and every single actor or actress playing in this movie are almost , if not perfect. The Godfather Part 2 & 3 are equally great and I wish movies today was just a tenth as good as these 3 movies!! Truly the greatest of all time. I could not possible pick a favorite scene because there are one too many iconic moments in this film. Of course if an offer I could not refuse was made to me... There would not be much I could do if you know what I mean. Al Pacino is still my favorite actor, the godfather movies are the reason!

Love it classic movie. I love the light and the contrasta. The shadows on this movie are so fantastic.
This movie deserves first place to the end.definitely not second place.
I believe the Godfather is the greatest film all time. Marlon Brando, who at first wasn't interested to play Don Vito Corleone, put down his most stunning performance ever. The characteristics, the voice of Brando match perfect with the some kind of mysterious Vito Corleone. This film is also the real start of the career of Al Pacino. After he played Michael Corleone, he was immediately given the role of young cop Serpico one year later in 1973. The best actors of two following eras meet here in this film. But the Godfather is more than just Brando or Pacino. We must certainly not forget the brilliant performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, all Oscar nominated. John Cazale playing Fredo Corleone stays a bit in the background. I liked him better in part 2. Francis Ford Coppola puts all this great actors together in a beautiful whole.
One of the greatest pieces every produced. Not only that, but the movie was made with scissors and tape, to put the scenes together. True look into the life a mob boss , with his family and the aftermath of his passing. After watching this movie, time after time, I still try to talk or act as Marlon Brando.
Godfather script portrays the duality of man: good vs evil, law abiding vs crime, loyalty vs betrayal, logic vs emotions, etc. It also warns of the long term consequences of our actions despite our short term intents and factors driving us to a certain path, which in the protagonist life, is crime.
The Godfather is among the hardly any films that does not have one flaw. Seeing The Godfather for The very first time was one of the most amazing Motion picture activities of my daily life. There is scenes that stay with you when the films over, therefore you remember them. Anyone can make the mistake of calling this film a Motion picture about criminal offense. Its definitely a Film about relatives. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I have observed the Film a minimum of 30, forty instances, and I'm nonetheless stunned at how excellent it is. The tunes, the performing, every little thing. Folks think that Citizen Kane is the greatest Motion picture at any time produced...perfectly, there's no way that ANYONE can believe Citizen Kane is a lot more moving, and it has a greater storyline compared to the Godfather. The matter I locate so astounding concerning the Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) improvements throughout the movie. Its my impression this is the greatest movie ever designed, and I doubt that any one can look at this Motion picture, and Believe I am ridiculous.
Now as I think, what to write about 'The Godfather' a thousand brilliant perspectives flash in my mind. Should I marvel at the mesmerizing story that surrounds you ever so sweetly or should I wonder about strong undertones which reveal themselves like shooting starts. Should I admire the vivid visualization of the dream or should I talk about the truth that emerges from it. Godfather might be a great movie to others but to me it is a journey through human mind, candid and knowing. The motives of a man and the eternal conflict with direction. All that is said about 'good', reveals itself in the story of this bad man. I am a fan of Vito Carlione, he is wise, he is respectful, he is a true capitalist. He is not bad himself but does not mind employing bad means. After all, some body has got to do the exploration. I can't say how thankful I am to people who made this movie for not spoiling my imagination. A truth well told is the biggest achievement.
It insists upon itself. Love the actors however, Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duval and plus. I myself have not seen this film until my 20s, I am still a youngster and i have much to learn regarding what exactly makes a film a great film, weather it be actors, camera work, great writing. I didn't want to check it out because it has been said its been the one of the greatest gangster films of all time. Thought it was just a film the was blown up and given so much praise because its what it is, The Godfathers. I finally gave it a shot and, although great i did not care to view the sequels. Maybe i will one day, but for now I am not to thrilled to check them out.
The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialog is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy about it.
The best movie of all time. The acting is amazing and the plot is the best i have ever seen! Coppola is a genious and Brando is the pure image of a great character!
Excellent story, a perfect scenario. Great actors and director has made the movie a masterpiece. This is a film that does not leave you indifferent after watching. For a long time I had to force myself to watch this movie. I now regret that I did not saw it before because I didn't started in time to appreciate the Al Pacino acting and Francis Copolla work. And of course, it is needless to mention the excellent work of Marlon Brando. This movie makes you to fall in love with New York in the 1920s, and to wish that you were born in that time. This is one of those rare movies whose II and III part are not ruininig the whole story and the overall impression of the film. The second and third sequel even more complete story. In addition to the excellent story and acting, and you will enjoy the artistic dimension of this masterpiece.

Excellent, outstanding for ever... This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well... Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.

Additionally all, "The Godfather " is a portrait of its time period and so it goes on all the other works of the trilogy. The film is built upon a significant historical period, shows not only the role of foreign immigrants and their difficulties in building an identity in America as it is also very thorough in addressing how the Italian mafia was organised for several decades in USA. For this and more, " The Godfather " is a film which must be seen, a reference that needs to be seen by all those who love movies and want to understand the social development of the United States at the beginning of the last century.
This movie is awesome. Don Vito Corleone character was amused. I really liked the concept very much. The movie represents the real Gang type of thing. The godfather scenario. The other parts of godfather movies are also very good.The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The Al Pacino character was also a strong character. Overall its a great movie to watch.It spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. Worth the full time of watching. Deserves a rating 10 from me. Christopher Nolan is the boss.
This is my all time favorite movie and when people ask me why it is my favorite movie,always tell them the same reasons. The characters are amazing some of my all time favorite characters Vito Corleone and his son Michael Corleone are some of the most iconic memorable and interesting characters of all time, the acting in this movie is perfect from every cast member even smaller roles are incredible well acted, i still don't understand how Al Pacino never won an Oscar for his role in these movies. The story is incredible, unpredictable unique and interesting, and for a movie over 40 years old, its steal amazing the story arc and feelings of the characters, it as aged incredible well. The director Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job, its incredible well directed.

Great movie from beginning to end. Best in the trilogy. Great cast. Two thumbs up. 10 stars.
Vito: personagem forte, carisma através de uma postura firme e empática. Construção a partir do personagem pronto, retrocedendo para sua origem.......
Amazing To Watch !

I have been late out but most of my time i enjoy to watch this movie.
Movie is just Love! The remarkable thing is that the first priority of Godfather is his family. Movie is just telling you how do you gain respect in your life but without family everything is useless. The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you've never seen it, you know the lines ("Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"), and some of the scenes (the horse's head). But there's more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche
I had great expectations on this trilogy because of everybody says it was good.

Definitely , they seemed rubbish the 3 of them to me.

Long and boring.

Besides i got lost with so many characters and actions so i had to rewind the movie so many times that i spend much more time than usual viewing this film.

All for you, because to me is a F*****G S**T.

PS: I don't understand how can i be the only one who doesn't like this movies although i am a great movie fan.
An acclaimed film that deserves its acclaim, The Godfather validates the crime epic and explores the dark side of the American dream. The Godfather is simply a classy production; unlike the mass of movies, most of which can each be criticized on some level, The Godfather manages to engage its audience throughout, and the portrayals of Brando, Pacino and Duvall, to name a few, were instant classics. Moreover, the film is memorable, in particular for its performances, assured direction and insightful depiction of the corridors of power of the American Mafia (not to mention it's extremely quotable). I did not give it ten out of ten for this reason: it did not move me so much as some other films. The Godfather is not my favorite movie, but I can see how for many people it is.
Well, I got a deal you can't refuse.. The best movie ever! The crew seems just like hand-picked. Camera angles are great. I really appreciate how much training and effort were done for the movie. I think its title one of the most enticing features.. When you say "Godfather", it just feels like a totally solid and amazing production.

Al Pacino is a level-headed and well-behaved man who is my favorite actor of all times. I can't think of better than that. This is a movie that feels like you are just part of it and that feeling melts my heart. I think they way they apply makeup to Don Vito is just.. amazing! Fredo is a great addition as he was able to reflect a passive-careless family member of most of us have probably experienced somewhere and somehow.

Without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made. Way beyond its time, it ticks the list of what every film should be looking to achieve if they want to make a great film. Undeniably, a classic and will never become something you find boring to watch. When people tell me they didn't like it because it was too long, I feel like never talking to them again. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, two of the greatest actors to have ever lived. And a score to stick with you until the end. A classic for the ages.
This movie or the game. Anyway who doesn't like power, money, guns and ladies!
I watched the movie so many time. Each time I watch, I learn something new. The movie shows the principal of life. There are things that we need to respect. There are things that we need to sacrifice. There are things that we need to learn how to wait.

It's a movie that talks about a big Mafia family but not just that. When I go out too often, I always think of this movie when the godfather asked his son did he eat at home with family? if not, he is not a real man.

There are a lot of great things you can learn from the movie. A classic that you must watch!
With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless.

This is the kind of movie that is essential to watch in your life.
The best of the series ever. Rearing up of American Cinema started after the production of this Movie. This compelling movie of mafia and family life is superb in every department, writing, acting, directing, a highlight of Coppola's career as well as of New American Cinema. Don't miss an opportunity to see a classic such as this on the big screen. The Godfather films remain so powerful, so ubiquitous, because in the Corleones we see the American Dream -- and in turn, ourselves. So it's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. That lasting popularity isn't a fluke; the "Godfather" films stand the test of time because these aren't just movies, they're also cultural touchstones. El grand!
This movie is masterpiece of cinematography. The story, characters, action and massage of this film is brilliant.
Movie of its time. Concentration, commitment, and investment is required. It is a joy to watch this movie.

Best quote in this movie is in my opinion: "Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than the government. It is almost the equal of family. - Don Corleone"

Be prepared for a fairly involved plot with plenty of long conversation scenes. Great acting and great depiction of total moral downfall.

I really like the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent. Every facial expression and every word of dialogue was brilliantly judged.
I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, musicin the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.
It's an excellent movie. Needless to say, a masterpiece
I once lived in a house with a gym and the others rented all the Godfather videos and played them back to back continuously forom Friday to Monday allowing anyone to come in and watch them. The room was full all weekend and I didn't go out for four days... and you know what? I'd do it again like a shot! I love the whole Godfather series. Full marks.

The Godfather is the most memorable, most influential, most quoted, most beloved, most discussed, most imitated, most revered and most entertaining American movie ever made.
There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale.
The screen writing and cinematography are absolutely incredible for their time and still is today. The way the movie flows just works and the characters have such well, thought out backgrounds and how they interact with each other. Between the protagonist and antagonists of the story plot, it all just worked out well.
This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.

To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Like Scarfaced this film can be watched and rewatched many times for decades to come!
One of the best movies I've ever seen in the entire 41 years of my life. I first watched it back in 96, and I haven't stopped watching year by year. I watch all 3 parts on a yearly bases, and its always seem to be during the holidays.

I know this is not your typical holiday movie, but it has food, family and love, which translate to me Holiday movie for grownups.

I think I will continue to watch it as long as am alive. There is truly no other Mafia movie that can come close to the drama and love this movie has and delivered to the viewer.

I strongly recommend it to those young generation to learn what being loyal is all about.
It's among the best films i have ever seen and watch again and again. Especially for Marlon Brando. Its a masterpiece.
The way the story is planted is very very good plus the excellent performance of the actors and the awesome work of all the production from the director till the minimum detail specialist. A good reflection of the violent human nature and the things that we as human beans are able to do to get and protect what we want. for me the most important aspect of the movie is the way it makes the emotions get touch in a very deep way. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.
Dad is one of the best movies I've seen. In addition to being successful as a cinematographer, he has also been successfully adapted from his book. Although Marlon Brando exhibited his best father performance, Al Pacino showed a better father performance. The film was a political analysis of that period, when the American filmmaker was very good at describing that period. the first film is perfect as well as it is still so beautiful in the film. but the third movie is a little unsuccessful. everyone is an excellent masterpiece that can be recommended. good looking...
This is the movie that created the mobster genre. It took mob movies to an entirely new level of depth. Plot, dialogue, intrigue, all top notch to compliment the action. In addition the cast was legendary and all of them were at the top of their game. If you ever thought all mob movies are the same it is because they all copied The Godfather!
This movie certainly does not need a review for sure. Commanding performance of entire cast, all dialogues are already written in silver line, epic scenes and marvellous acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, brilliant direction.
Perfect movie does not exist.

Godfather : Hold my wine!
Evil attracts people like a magnet. Wherefore, with movies like this, always earns a lot of money if he is to still acting well equipped. The story, although fictional, describes effective where the greed leads for power and money. Generations kill themselves to get in a short life to power, money and influence. When viewers the baser instincts are addressed. You may find yourself doing that you feel satisfaction when a bad guy kills an even nastier. You can dismiss this as "Movie", but in reality everything is worse. What finally remains at the end of life, how early it always ends left? This shows not this movie. Namely a body in a box.
I love this movie and all of the GF movies. This movie deserves first rank in top 250
This movie one of the greatest movies in all time, but i think it is not for 2000s generation.
Pedra angular do cinema americano e mundial, atuações de peso e marcantes
What an interesting movie to watch. I've watched partially of the movie recently but it looks very interesting to watch.
Good acting of the actors, awesome story, awesome musice, awesome directory and..... Are the power points of this masterpiece
It's always a pleasure to watch this movie which never seems to get old.
This movie was outstanding for me, because this brilliant idea from mario puzzo and great performance all actor make many people's believe that on that year (which movie set take), the situation looks very real happened in US in general.

For me, this looks shocking also for US people its self, because they finally realize that something already happened in their next-door neighbor that they never aware of previously For some people, it has changed their lifestyle than before.

This movie tell us how to manage the family relationship and financial condition of our families, it's also teach us that not easy to run a government, especially with the present of members of our family in it

Wonderful
Once you see part 1 you will have to see part 2 and 3 following it. There is just no way around it...This fist time I saw Godfather part 1 I couldn't appreciate it seeing as i was only 10 years old. But now i am 21 and that has changed. I major theme throughout the movie is of course "family". This movie can be called the best because it is without a doubt flawless. I challenge you to find anything you didn't like about the film. Mario Puzo is a genius and Marlon Brando acting was excellent. His career was already excellent but i think that after making a film like The Godfather, he will forever be known as Vito Corleone aka "The Godfather". There will never be a film more powerful and remarkable then this.
This trilogy is one of the most known trilogy of the world. The rise of the Michael Carloene could be the most epic rise of an any character. There are some people who call this movie cult. However, this is the cornerstone of the cinema and may be the most known movie of the world. I dont think that it is cult movie.

I've learned so much from this movie on how to be a man and how to address challenges and difficuties as a man.
The late great Gordon Willis changed cinematographer forever in this classic film. Ordinarily during this time, an eye light was routinely used on the lead actor in order to better expose the eyes: an important part of the performance. To the dismay of the studio executives, Willis decided to let Marlon Brando's eyes fall into shadow, creating an ominous cinematographic look that is indelibly inscribed into the consciousness of filmmakers. Since his contribution to cinematography, we now embrace a much more naturalistic approach to lighting which has allowed for interesting photography to flourish.

Rest in Peace, Gordon Willis.
Great movie, Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour.I'll
The finest mafia film and the finest family i have ever watched. The craft of cinema is at its best in godfather series.Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino).

The casting was the best in history. And the director was into every single scene
One of the best legendary crime tragedy movie I have ever seen , touching my soul , fabulous acting , unforgettable scenes .
The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome.This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well.

This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 48 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.
Maybe that's because we youth have different brains from people from that age. I enjoyed the movie and it's incredible but there is 30 or 40 minutes that feels like a filler but yeah can't complain about it.
My favorite movie.. I liked cinema thanks to this film. It is a masterpiece..
I'll keep it short because it's all been said at one point or another. Without a doubt, The Godfather is one of the best of all-time. Its a rarity when a film is firing on all cylinders; from story, cast, cinematography, editing, directing, etc. Francis Ford Coppolla gives us such a beautifully crafted story that its easy to miss some of the wonderfully subtitle (yet so grand) acting going on within it. Marlon Brando is something to behold as he plays one of the most iconic characters in film history. A man responsible for such terrible things, and yet you're rooting for him in almost every scene. The way he pushes his character to the brink of madness in the most subtle of ways should be a textbook for future actors. For anyone that is a fan of the "gangster" film genre its a must-see. If one can't appreciate the content of the story, one has to admire how the story is presented.
Easily the best movie i have ever seen. It is just peferct, the entire movie made me speechless. Perfet acting, perfect writing and perfect directing. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando gave us some of the best acting of all time, along with the genius directing of Francis ford Coppola. An instant master piece.
Classic! The best film i've ever seen. My grandchilds will be know this film.
Must see movie of all times love this movie all of the godfathers movies
Godfather All time Fav and most famous acting style

I didn't get why The Shawshank Redemption is best movie in history. Because It made in 1994. But this THE GODFATHER smell like history and it deserves to be most movie in history of world.
I found character what would be like real men from that movie. If you don't like be a man you'll lose all of yourself.
I have just seen the movie and I must admit I'm totally blown away. Of course I've heard of it, seen clips, told of it's brilliance, but nothing could have prepared me for this movie. "Fantastic" is the word. The actors are amazing - every one of them. You love, you hate, you cry. No emotion is left untouched. I don't think I need to write any further. The plot, the characters etc. have been described over and over, and all I have yet to do is give my strongest recommendation. If you are a girl like myself you will for certain fall deeply in love with the human, but dangerous young Al Pacino (and he is drop dead gorgeous too!)

A classic!



I saw the full movie that is totally marvelous. Love the producers and love the creators who produce the awesome movie for us.........................................................................................

Pure cinema. The best of the best! Textbook standard of filmmaking, music, cinematography and direction.
Best movie ever made!This movie describes the real life, what was happening in those years. I like this movie because it shows, how real man were, how to be a real man. Nowdays you don't see this that much, the people don't honor the elders and there are many more snitches than it used to be. The respect for people is gone. Everybody thinks that they are tough, but when it comes to real situation they turn their backs around and walk away. In this movie you see the opposite. You see how everything was handeld and you know what it was the good way I think. The life is tough and if we don't face it that way like in this movie we cant survive. I watched this movie like 100 times and I can watch it like 100 times more.
A master piece by Francis Ford Coppola and screenplay is fab. keep inspiring us and new film makers. The story writer put all inputs to bind the audience throughout the film. Cinematography and shots are well designed and executed by the makers. I watched this 5 times, first it was in my syllabus and then i loved it.
The Godfather is generally considered one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion this stands, however it is nowhere near perfect. Most of the acting is very good, such as Marlon Brando's and Robert Duvall's performances, however Al Pacino's and Diane Keaton's performances are lacking. Talia Shire and James Caan give good performances, but not as remarkable as Brando's. The atmosphere of the movie is aided by the darkness in some of the settings, particularly those of the house. The film, on the other hand, is slightly too long . Some of the scenes could have been cut, and some sequences shortened, and the result would have been better. All in all this is a spectacular movie, which I urge you to see, but it is somewhat flawed.

The godfather is the most favorite movie ever the three parts are the most great movies in the history in my opinion it contain the fathers of our cinema now days, a story that tell the truth about the mafia and even the people who control the illegal business and the way that end up. shows the family that always feel proud of its own Sicilian origin's i already watched this movie more that 12 time with friends, family, and I'm even ready to watch it more and more, Don Corleone is one of my favorite characters and the way he always shows of the strong man that doesn't know how to bow and give up easily and at the same time you can see the part of care about his family in the last seine and the part of killing his eldest son Tom, and always KEEP YOUR FRIEND CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMY CLOSER.
Probably one of the best movies ever made! so its 10 of 10 from me. Wish we could have more good movies like this one now days.
Despite of the fact that this movie is so long, I watched it tens of times. Every time I watch, I feel like to start a gang and get killed.
This movie is pure of violence, massacres, deaths, killings which I hoped that there is nothing like this anymore in our generation. I somehow like the movie for its showing the reality that we're in. Nevertheless, this is something thats not be shown to our children.
Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a "godfather" or "don," the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family "business."
If you haven't seen this movie and you love Filmmaking... something is wrong.

10/10 loooooooooooooooooooooove it.

Simply Brilliant.
Best film i know very good wallah c dla frappe ya rien a dire un peu long mais tres lourd
The world works differently in 1940's New York City, especially if you were a Sicilian. The Godfather, in all its twists and turns that coincide with the style of living in the mafia, sets itself aside from all other gangster/mob/mafia movies by providing a transformation unlike any other. This change, however, comes from an individual that you, as a watcher, wouldn't want it to come from, until you do. The hook is in the constant re-occurrence of the meaning of loyalty to an Italian.

Advice for first time viewers: watch with someone who has seen it before, because you will get lost at some points and will need the legal and mafia jargon explained.
I watched the movie many times and each time find something new.
Grew up on this movie, like millions of others in Russia! Never gets old to watch!
Is the greatest of all time .....cant get bored of watching the triology
Marlon Brando Became Don Vito, such a believable performance.
The Godfather if you don't know is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. It's brilliant! Brando is great. Pacino is great. De Niro is great. Duvall is great. Sonny is great (although I don't know his name). In fact all the Corleones are great along with all the cast. I'm commenting on all three of the movies as a saga as they're all superb but part 2 is something else as many people agree. You may think I go hard when commenting on this trilogy but seriously, it's excellent. I definitely recommend you to own a copy of The Godfather at least and I'm disappointed that I wasn't born when the movies were released as they would've been quality cinema I think.

It's telling you something.

Watch before you die , maybe you will not like it but you will understand what I mean.
Amazing, exelent movie, saw it when i was young, and still amazing!
I think that the Godfather is an American classic, that perfectly mixes film and real history regarding the Italian mafia. I watched this film with my grandfather, and it was the basis for my senior thesis. i have studied Coppola' touch, and am studying to be a director myself. The Godfather is the reason that i myself am invested in the film industry. i want to make movies for the records. I want to make movies that for generations will be remembered. The cinematography is stellar, and the acting is classic. Al Pacino is playing a golden role and Marlon Brando live through these characters. this movie all around is one of the greatest movies every made for the silver screen.

Love every bit of this movie! Everything and everyone that was involved with it did such an amazing job acting and portraying the mafia and people of that time period!
Although I watched the movie a logn time ago, it is just unforgettable! From directing to acting, the film is a diamond!
The Godfather trilogy, and particularly its first two films, are iconic and ingratiated in the American cultural discussions of cinema and art so deeply that they're hard to parse from their legendary status. They're timeless epics that serve the viewer and the cinema-lover better as tall tales of kings, not as any introspective look at America or the 'immigrant experience.' From an artistic standpoint, their place in cinema is unquestioned in terms of its indelible effect on culture. One can gather that if the apex of Hollywood studio filmmaking in all its capitalist limitations, can be capped at using the visual tools of cinema at the service of a story, I can't think of many movies that do it better than The Godfather.
Parents need to know that this movie contains graphic violence. There are machine gun killings, brutal beatings, betrayals, blood. The murders are not unnecessarily gory or lengthy, but their startling abruptness and the expressions of horror on the victims' faces make these images unforgettable. The violence always has gravity. There is brief nudity and sex, and a few curse words. Children too young to see the violence in this film wouldn't be able to appreciate the intricacies of the plot and so would have no interest in the movie.
Marlon Brandi was born to play this role, The Don Corleone in the Godfather It would have been great had he lived longer and could have.reprise somed his role then appeared in the last two movies. The Godfather movie seemed so real it made me feel like I was.there, really.there! I don't know if this movie could be remade,however it might be interesting.for the younger generation to see some of their favorite actors playing in.such iconic roles.

Actually its not a review... it's a humble request, or maybe a favor. Please watch this movie. It's all you can ask for in a movie. 10/10

This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.
The best movie ever, i liked so much, i recomend watch this movie, once a year.
Either you like it or you don't get attracted. There is no way between the two interests.

Personal opinion: must-see film which presents the world of mafia(s) quite realistic.

Besides that, actors' performances are more than awesome.
So happy to watch this Movie............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
It's a great film which create on 1972, I've seen it, and it changes my life. So I think you must watch this film in one time in your life. Before you watch, i suggestion you grab a popcorn and watch with your partner.
An exciting, long movie with a top cast. It is very handsome that the second part not under does for the first part. Both parts certainly have a place in my top 10.

A true classic. I immediately had sympathy for the characters in the movie, with no real knowledge. Which is very up to the family is that everything is running. (OTF)

The Godfather movies are real must views for every mafia film follower. The main characters are excellent on the folder set by actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in the second part, who plays the young Vito Corleone.
It is one of the best books and movie that i read and watch. I've read them to learn something from them, to learn how to live in the broadest sense of the term, and there were books which offered me support. I agree with other reviews, this movie also has great Gifs. Most watch and read.
Great movie, i loved the writing involved showing how what happens in Italian families.
This movie will remain the best in history... This is A lesson in film-making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers.

Seem pretty boring for me want my type, plus its an old movie
Great gangster movie, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. And its deaths
It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed
